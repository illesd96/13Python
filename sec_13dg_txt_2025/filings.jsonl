The Reporting Persons analyze the operations, capital structure and markets of companies in which they invest, including the Issuer, on a continuous basis through analysis of documentation and discussions with knowledgeable industry and market observers and with representatives of such companies (often at the invitation of management).  As a result of these analytical activities one or more of the Reporting Persons may issue analysts reports, participate in interviews or hold discussions with third parties, with management or with Directors in which the Reporting Person may suggest or take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations, management or capital structure of such companies as a means of enhancing shareholder values.  Such suggestions or positions may relate to one or more of the transactions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D including, without limitation, such matters as disposing of one or more businesses, selling the company or acquiring another company or business, changing operating or marketing strategies, adopting or not adopting, certain types of anti-takeover measures and restructuring the company capitalization or dividend policy.\n\nEach of the Reporting Persons intends to adhere to the foregoing investment philosophy with respect to the Issuer.  However, none of the Reporting Persons intends to seek control of the Issuer or participate in the management of the Issuer, and any Reporting Person that is registered as an investment company under the Company Act will participate in such a transaction only following receipt of an exemption from the SEC under Rule 17d-1 under the Company Act, if required, and in accordance with other applicable law.  In pursuing this investment philosophy, each Reporting Person will continuously assess the Issuers business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuers securities in particular, other developments and other investment opportunities, as well as the investment objectives and diversification requirements of its shareholders or clients and its fiduciary duties to such shareholders or clients.  Depending on such assessments, one or more of the Reporting Persons may acquire additional Securities or may determine to sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of its holdings of Securities.  Although the Reporting Persons share the same basic investment philosophy and although most portfolio decisions are made by or under the supervision of Mario Gabelli, the investment objectives and diversification requirements of various clients differ from those of other clients so that one or more Reporting Persons may be acquiring Securities while others are disposing of Securities.\n\n\nWith respect to voting of the Securities, the Reporting Persons have adopted general voting policies relating to voting on specified issues affecting corporate governance and shareholder values.  Under these policies, the Reporting Persons generally vote all securities over which they have voting power in favor of cumulative voting, financially reasonable golden parachutes, one share one vote, management cash incentives and pre-emptive rights and against greenmail, poison pills, supermajority voting, blank check preferred stock and super-dilutive stock options.  Exceptions may be made when management otherwise demonstrates superior sensitivity to the needs of shareholders.  In the event that the aggregate voting position of all Reporting Persons exceeds 25% of the total voting position of the Issuer, one or more of the filing persons may transfer voting and/or dispositive power over shares to independent committees of directors or the owners of such shares. Such committees vote and/or consider disposition of such shares independently of the Reporting Persons.\n\nEach of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting Person has purchased the Securities reported herein as beneficially owned by him for investment for his own account or that of one or more members of his immediate family.  Each such person may acquire additional Securities or dispose of some or all of the Securities reported herein with respect to him.\n\nOther than as described above, none of the Reporting Persons and none of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting Person has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, change or event specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.", "item6_contracts_arrangements": "The powers of disposition and voting of Gabelli Funds, Teton Advisors, GAMCO, GCIA and MJG Associates with respect to Securities owned beneficially by them on behalf of their investment advisory clients, and of MJG Associates and GCIA with respect to Securities owned beneficially by them on behalf of the partnerships or corporations which they directly or indirectly manage, are held pursuant to written agreements with such clients, partnerships and funds."}

Additionally, the Reporting Person beneficially owned 135 shares of RET Class A Common Stock, 16 shares of RET Class B Common Stock, and 1,000 RET Options.\n\nOn December 17, 2024, in connection with the Business Combination, Berto entered into an agreement (the \"Warrant Exchange Agreement\") with Coliseum and the Issuer and the other parties thereto to exchange, subject to the closing of the Business Combination, all 2,257,000 Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) held by it for shares of Holdco Class A Common Stock, at an exchange ratio of 0.25 shares of Class A Common Stock per Private Placement Warrant (the \"Warrant Exchange\"). Prior to the Warrant Exchange, such warrants (the \"Private Placement Warrants\") pursuant to their terms were exercisable for Coliseum Class A Ordinary Shares at an initial exercise price of $11.50 per share beginning 30 days after the closing of the Business Combination. Accordingly, as a result of the Warrant Exchange, the Issuer issued to Berto 564,250 shares of Class A Common Stock at the closing of the Business Combination and such Private Placement Warrants were cancelled and no longer outstanding. The shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the Warrant Exchange are subject to a two-year lockup following the closing of the Business Combination and will be treated for all purposes as \"Lock-Up Shares\" under the Lock-up Agreement, described below.\n\nEffective as of December 20, 2024, the Reporting Person transferred by gift 1,550,000 Coliseum Class A Ordinary Shares, for no consideration.\n\nBetween December 20, 2024 and December 31, 2024, the Issuer entered into subscription agreements (\"Subscription Agreement\") with investors, including an affiliate of the Reporting Person, for the sale in a private placement of an aggregate of $1.35 million of Class A Common Stock at a price per share of at a purchase price of approximately $11.39 per share, which was the expected approximate per share redemption price of the Coliseum Public Shares in the Business Combination (the \"PIPE Investment\").

As of the date of this Report, the Reporting Person's affiliate has not funded its subscription.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. You forfeited 428,880 Coliseum Class A Ordinary Shares (the \"Forfeited Shares\") for no consideration pursuant to the terms of Extension Non-Redemption Agreements entered into in November 2023 by Mr. You, Coliseum Acquisition Corp., and the Coliseum shareholders party thereto.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement consummated the Business Combination, Warrant Exchange, and $700,000 of the PIPE Investment (the \"Closing\").

The Lock-Up will not apply to any shares of Class A Common Stock acquired by the Reporting Person's affiliate in the PIPE Investment.\n\nAlso on December 31, 2024, in connection with the Closing and as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Issuer entered into a registration rights agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with certain shareholders, including the Reporting Person, pursuant to which the Issuer agreed to register for resale certain shares of Class A Common Stock and other Issuer equity securities held by the parties thereto from time to time.\n\nAs of the Closing, the Reporting Person beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,408,541 shares of Class A Common Stock, 23,101 shares of Class B Common Stock, and 1,433,892 Options which are fully vested and exercisable for 1,433,892 shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\nPlans or Proposals\n\nMr. You is a director of the Issuer and the chairman of the Issuer's Board of Directors (the \"Board\").

Additionally, as a holder of Class B Common Stock, the Reporting Person has certain governance rights that are not shared by the holders of Class A Common Stock. See Item 6 - Dual Class Common Stock Structure.\n\nThe Reporting Person has acquired the shares reported herein for investment purposes. The Reporting Person reviews and intends to continue to review, on an ongoing and continued basis, the Reporting Person's investments in the Issuer. The Reporting Person may seek to acquire additional securities of the Issuer (which may include rights or securities exercisable or convertible into securities of the Issuer) from time to time, and/or may seek to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the Issuer's securities from time to time, in each case, in open market or private transactions, block sales or otherwise, including in connection with extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a tender offer, merger or consolidation that would result in the de-listing of the Common Stock, or through in-kind distributions. The Reporting Person expects to continue to actively evaluate such transactions, and to take other actions intended to position the Reporting Person to opportunistically engage in one or more of such transactions in the future. Any transactions that the Reporting Person may pursue may be made at any time and from time to time without prior notice and will depend upon a variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices of the securities of the Issuer, the financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, general economic, financial market and industry conditions, other investment and business opportunities available to the Reporting Person, tax considerations and other factors considered relevant by the Reporting Person.\n\nExcept as described in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Person does not have any present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D, although the Reporting Persons, at any time and from time to time, may review, reconsider and change such position and/or change their purpose and/or develop such plans and may seek to influence management of the Issuer or the Board with respect to the business and affairs of the Issuer and may from time to time consider pursuing or proposing such matters with advisors, the Issuer or other persons.", "item6_contracts_arrangements": "The information set forth in Item 4 above is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 6.\n\nDual Class Common Stock Structure\n\nThe Issuer has two classes of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Issuer's Amended and Restated Articles of Organization (the \"A&R Articles\"), adopted in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock have identical economic rights, including dividend and liquidation rights. Shares of Class A Common Stock entitle the holders thereof to one vote per share on all matters on which the shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled to vote, and Class B Common Stock entitle the holders thereof to fifteen votes per share on all matters on which the shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote.\n\nEach share of Class B Common Stock will be convertible into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder at any time, and will automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the earlier to occur of (i) five (5) years from the completion of the Business Combination, (ii) the date on which the initial holders of the Class B Common Stock or their Permitted Transferees (as defined in the A&R Articles) collectively own twenty percent (20%) or less of the number of shares of Class B Common Stock collectively held by such persons or their Permitted Transferees immediately after the completion of the Business Combination, (iii) upon the occurrence of a transfer of Class B Common Stock that is not a Permitted Transfer, and (iv) the date specified by the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of the Class B Common Stock.\n\nThe holders of Class B Common Stock have certain governance rights that are not shared by the holders of Class A Common Stock. Such rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock include:\n\nThe right to fill vacancies on the board - the A&R Articles and the Issuer's Amended and Restated Bylaws (\"A&R Bylaws\") provide that, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors may be fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board; provided, however, that before the first date on which the initial holders of the Class B Common Stock or their Permitted Transferees collectively beneficially own 20% or less of the number of shares of Class B Common Stock (as such number of shares is equitably adjusted in respect of any reclassification, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or recapitalization of the Class B Common Stock) collectively held by them as of the Closing (the \"Voting Threshold Date\"), any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors and any vacancies occurring in the Board, will be filled solely by the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the Class B Common Stock. On and after the Voting Threshold Date, any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors and any vacancies occurring in the Board, will be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by shareholders.\n\nThe right to call special meetings of shareholders - the A&R Articles provides that, prior to the Voting Threshold Date, special meetings of shareholders may be called by or at the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.\n\nShareholder action by written consent - the A&R Articles provides that, prior to the Voting Threshold Date, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting, provided that (i) shareholders who own, in the aggregate, not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at any annual or proposed special meeting of the Issuer, as determined in accordance with the A&R Articles, shall by written notice to the Secretary of the Issuer request that the Board fix a record date for the proposed action by shareholders including the information required by the A&R Bylaws, (ii) the Issuer solicits written consents from all shareholders, and (iii) such action is evidenced by a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, which is signed and delivered to the Secretary of the Issuer, and not revoked, by shareholders having the requisite votes; provided, further, that any such action shall be taken in accordance with, and subject to the A&R Bylaws, the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act and applicable law. Following the Voting Threshold Date, except for shareholder action by unanimous written consent, any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders and may not be effected by consent in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding any provision of the A&R Articles or the A&R Bylaws to the contrary, shareholders may act without a meeting by unanimous written consent, and none of the foregoing provisions shall apply to such action. Any action by written consent must be a proper subject for shareholder action by written consent.\n\nAmendments to the A&R Articles - the A&R Articles provides that, prior to the Voting Threshold Date, any amendment to the A&R Articles will require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all shares entitled generally to vote on such matter. On and after the Voting Threshold Date, any amendment to the A&R Articles will require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all shares entitled generally to vote on such matter, and in addition, a majority of the shares of any voting group entitled to vote separately on the matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, by the A&R Articles or the A&R Bylaws, or by action of the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as any shares of Class A Common Stock are outstanding, the Issuer shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or the A&R Articles, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of the A&R Articles (1) in a manner that is inconsistent with, or that otherwise alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of Class A Common Stock so as to affect them adversely; or (2) to provide for each share of Class B Common Stock to have more than fifteen (15) votes per share or any rights to a separate class vote of the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock other than as provided by the A&R Articles or the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act.\n\nIndemnification Agreement\n\nAs a director of the Issuer, Mr. You entered into the Issuer's standard form of Indemnification Agreement (the \"Indemnification Agreement\"). The Indemnification Agreement provides for indemnification and advancement by the Issuer of certain expenses and costs relating to claims, suits, or proceedings arising from service by Mr. You to the Issuer or, at its request, service to other entities, as a director to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nLine of Credit\n\nOn December 30, 2024, Mr. You and an entity affiliated with Mr. You entered into a loan agreement (the \"Loan\") with the Issuer which provides a commitment of up to $7,000,000, which may be drawn down by the Issuer from time to time during the two-year period after the Closing, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Loan. Additionally, the Reporting Person converted an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million of loans and advances owed to the Reporting Person by Coliseum and an aggregate of approximately $550,000 of loans and advances owed to the Reporting Person by RET into loans outstanding pursuant to the Loan (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not decrease the Reporting Person's $7 million commitment). The Loan bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, and matures on the second anniversary of the Closing, or earlier upon a change of control of the Issuer. If any interest payment is not made when due, such interest payment will capitalize at a rate of 7%. The foregoing description of the Loan Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Loan Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference."}

Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, the Blocker could not be changed without written consent of the Issuer.\n\nOn August 26, 2024, the Issuer effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") in which every 20 issued shares of Common Stock was automatically reclassified into one issued share of Common Stock. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Consequently, the Reporting Persons beneficially owned a total of 467,248 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Warrants, subject to the Blocker. Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split, the exercise price of the Warrants was increased to $6.20 per share.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, the Blue Torch Funds and the Issuer agreed to increase the Blocker to 9.99%.

The Reporting Persons believe that Mr. Richey's significant experience in the medical device industry, knowledge and experience with respect to leading medical device companies, financing and strategic initiatives, will provide valuable leadership and strategic guidance to the Board and the Issuer's management. Mr. Richey currently serves as a consultant to RTW Investments.\n\nItem 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby incorporated by reference.", "item6_contracts_arrangements": "Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:\n\nAmendment to Note Purchase Agreement and RIFAs\n\nAs previously disclosed, on April 14, 2024, RTW Investments and the other purchasers thereto entered into a note purchase agreement with the Issuer and Acquiom Agency Services LLC, as collateral agent for the purchasers (the \"Purchasers\"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Issuer issued and sold $48 million of convertible senior secured notes (the \"Notes\") to RTW Investments and the Purchasers in a private placement. In addition, on February 9, 2023, Allurion Technologies, LLC (\"Allurion Opco\") entered into a Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (as amended, the \"First RIFA\") with certain entities which have engaged RTW Investments as investment manager (the \"First RIFA Investors\"), pursuant to which, among other things, Allurion Opco secured a $40 million investment from the First RIFA Investors. On October 30, 2024, Allurion Opco entered into a Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (as amended, the \"Second RIFA\" and, together with the First RIFA, the \"RIFAs\") (the RIFAs collectively with the Note Purchase Agreement, the \"Existing Documents\") with certain entities that have engaged RTW investments as investment manager (the \"Second RIFA Investors\" and, together with the First RIFA Investors, the \"Investors\"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Second RIFA Investors purchased a $7.5 million  synthetic royalty interest.\n\nOn January 7, 2025, the Issuer, RTW Investments, and the other parties thereto entered in an Omnibus Amendment (the \"Omnibus Amendment\") to the Note Purchase Agreement and the RIFAs. The Omnibus Amendment requires, among other things, (i) the Issuer and Allurion Opco to maintain certain minimum balances of unrestricted cash in controlled accounts in the U.S. in the amounts corresponding to the calculations set forth therein, and (ii) the Issuer to receive minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated Revenue (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) in amounts set forth therein, tested quarterly beginning with the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025. The Omnibus Amendment also requires that (i) Allurion France shall have successfully regained marketing authorization from the Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante to resume the Commercialization (as defined in the Existing Documents) of the Product (as defined in the Existing Documents) in France on or prior to December 31, 2025 and (ii) Allurion OpCo shall have received Marketing Authorization from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for the Commercialization of the Product in the United States no later than June 30, 2026.\n\nPursuant to the Omnibus Amendment, the Investors and the Purchasers will receive a number of shares of the Issuer's Shares representing in the aggregate five percent (5%) of the fully-diluted shares outstanding immediately after the closing of the offering and sale of Additional Shares (as defined in the Existing Documents) to be consummated no later than February 15, 2025, in connection with which the Issuer shall have raised at least $12 million aggregate net proceeds (the \"Amendment Fee\"); provided that, in the event the Issuer cannot issue Shares to the Investors and the Purchasers due to applicable law or New York Stock Exchange listing rules, the Issuer will instead issue an equivalent (as-converted) number of shares of a newly created series of Series A-1 non-voting preferred stock (the \"Series A-1 Preferred Stock\") and the Issuer shall include a proposal in a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A seeking stockholder approval no later than December 31, 2025 to allow the conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Shares; provided further that, each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding on December 31, 2026 (the \"Redemption Date\") will, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (including the Delaware General Corporation Law), be redeemed by the Issuer for cash in an amount equal to the as-converted value of the underlying common stock.\n\nThe Omnibus Amendment also provides that the Issuer will ensure that RTW Investments and the Investors have the right to designate one director to the Board of Issuer, which director is currently Nicholas Lewin, and, as of the Amendment Effective Date (as defined in the Omnibus Amendment), also have the right to designate a second director to the Board, which additional director will initially be Jason Richey.\n\nThe foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Omnibus Amendment, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 99.18 hereto."}

The cash/stock election would be subject to proration intended to ensure that the Issuer maintains a public float of at least 13.6 million shares, or 30.8% of its then issued and outstanding share capital. The Pershing Square Funds would elect to roll-over their 37.6% stake in the Company (which will not be subject to proration).\n\nThe cash portion of the Proposal is expected to be funded by (1) PS Holdco acquiring 11,764,706 shares of Common Stock at $85 per share for $1 billion from its current balance sheet and (2) a $500 million simultaneous share repurchase by the Issuer at $85 per share for up to 5,882,353 shares of Common Stock financed by bonds newly issued by the Issuer. Based on the proposed structure and the likely resulting capitalization, Jefferies LLC, our financial advisor for the Proposal, believes that the financing should be ratings neutral to the Issuer. We have also received a letter from Jefferies LLC indicating that it is highly confident that the $500 million of bond financing will be available to complete the transaction.\n\nThe shares of Common Stock acquired by PS Holdco would be in addition to the Reporting Persons' current beneficial ownership of the Common Stock reported in the Schedule 13D. After giving effect to the Proposal (before giving effect to any investment by Strategic Partners as described below), the Reporting Persons expect to have beneficial ownership of a minimum of 61.1% and a maximum of 69.2% of the Issuer's Common Stock.\n\nPS Holdco may invite a small consortium of key strategic partners (the \"Strategic Partners\") to participate in the Proposal. Capital invested by these Strategic Partners would be available to increase balance sheet cash at the Issuer for future investment and/or reduce a portion of the Pershing Square Funds' beneficial ownership of the Issuer's Common Stock. The additional investment by Strategic Partners would not affect PS Holdco's investment in the Issuer or impact the Issuer's post-closing public float.\n\nThe Reporting Persons understand that the Board of Directors of the Issuer has appointed a Special Committee of independent directors to consider any proposal the Reporting Persons may make. The Reporting Persons are prepared to subject the Proposal to the prior approval of the Special Committee as well as to a non-waivable condition requiring the approval of holders of a majority of the Common Stock of the Issuer not owned by the Reporting Persons or parties affiliated with or advised by the Reporting Persons.\n\nNo assurances can be given regarding the terms and details of any potential transaction, that the Proposal or any other proposal made by the Reporting Persons regarding any potential transaction will be accepted by the Issuer and/or approved by its stockholders, that any financing necessary to consummate the potential transaction will be obtained, that definitive documents relating to any such potential transaction will be executed, or that a potential transaction will be consummated in accordance with such documents, if at all.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Proposal does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Proposal Letter, dated as of January 13, 2025, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.22 to the Schedule 13D and incorporated herein by reference.\n\nNeither the Schedule 13D nor the Proposal is an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. Any solicitation or offer will only be made through separate materials filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Holders of Common Stock of the Issuer will be able to obtain such documents (when and if available) free of charge at the Commission's web site, www.sec.gov.\n\nThe Reporting Persons reserve the right to modify the Proposal at any time.

Depending on their evaluation of various factors, the reporting persons may take such actions regarding their holdings of the Issuer's securities as they deem appropriate in light of circumstances existing from time to time. Such actions may include purchasing additional Common Stock in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions with third parties or otherwise,  and selling at any time, in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions with third parties or otherwise, all or part of the Common Stock that they now own or hereafter acquire.

Pursuant to such investment management agreements, EcoR1 is entitled to fees based on assets under management and realized and unrealized gains.\n\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\n\nOn December 23, 2023, the reporting persons entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Securities Purchase Agreement\") for a private placement with the Issuer. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the reporting persons purchased 5,086,521 pre-funded warrants (the \"Pre-Funded Warrants\") to purchase 5,086,521 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer (the \"Warrant Shares\").

The Maximum Percentage may be increased or decreased by the reporting persons with 61 days' written notice to the Issuer; provided, however, that such percentage may in no event exceed 19.99%.\n\nRegistration Rights Agreement\n\nThe reporting persons also entered into a registration rights agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with the Issuer on December 23, 2023, requiring the Issuer to register the resale of the Warrant Shares (the \"Registrable Securities\").

Payment of such liquidated damages shall be the reporting persons' exclusive remedy for such events. In addition, (i) the aggregate amount of liquidated damages payable to a reporting person shall not exceed, in the aggregate, six percent (6%) of the aggregate purchase price paid by such reporting person and (ii) the Issuer shall not be liable in any thirty (30) day period for liquidated damages in excess of one percent (1%) of the aggregate purchase price paid by the  reporting person.\n\nThe Issuer has granted the reporting persons customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration statement. The reporting persons have also granted the Issuer customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration statement.\n\nThe foregoing description of the material terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement  and the Form of Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock is qualified in its entirety by reference to those documents, each of which is referenced in Exhibits B, C and D hereto, respectively, and is incorporated by reference herein."}

In connection with the Financing Transaction, and as described in the Fifth Amendment and the Exchange Agreement in more detail, Q5 has agreed to exchange up to $29,110,000 of the principal amount of the Issuer's 5.000% Senior Notes due in 2029 (the \"Senior Notes\") held by Q5 for the corresponding principal amount of second lien senior secured PIK toggle notes to be issued by the Issuer, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement.  \r\n \r\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Fifth Amendment and the Exchange Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Fifth Amendment and Exchange Agreement, which are incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. \r\n \r\nThe terms of the Financing Transaction deliver on the requests previously made by the Reporting Person and described in this Schedule 13D, as amended.

In addition, the Reporting Person requested that four directors be replaced, and the terms of the Financing Transaction will result in three directors being appointed by the Issuer's investors.

Finally, the Reporting Person sought for the Issuer to shorten its timeline to review strategic alternatives, which is also now required under the terms of the Financing Transaction.  \r\n \r\nAs a result of these changes, the Reporting Person no longer seeks to influence the management of the Issuer and is now holding the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer for investment purposes only.

Sherwood Revocable Trust and Ned L. Sherwood (also referred to as the \"Reporting Persons\") entered into a cooperation and support agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Alex Kinzler (\"Kinzler\") and Barnwell Industries, Inc. (the \"Company\"). The standstill provisions in the Agreement were set to expire in approximately early February 2025, ten days prior to the due date for shareholder nominations. The prohibitions in the Agreement regarding the ability of the Reporting Persons to purchase additional shares of Common Stock expires as of the date of the filing of this Amendment No. 34.\n\nAs previously reported in Amendment No. 33, the Reporting Persons proposed certain amendments to the Agreement to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of the Company in order to avoid a costly proxy fight, including proposals regarding directors to be nominated to the Board. In addition to such proposed director nominations, the Reporting Persons offered to extend the existing Agreement and offered to purchase any additional shares directly from the Company rather than in open market purchases. Certain proposals were put forth by the Reporting Persons on December 5, 2024 (\"December 5 Proposal\") and December 16, 2024 (\"December 16 Proposal\").\n\nOn December 9, 2024 (\"December 9 Communication\"), the Reporting Persons received confirmation of its December 5 Proposal along with questions, and such confirmation indicated a \"Special Committee of the Board\" had been appointed. The Reporting Persons were informed that Mr. Grossman and Mr. Horowitz were the members of the \"Special Committee.\"\n\nThe communication back to the Board responded to the Board's questions in good faith and requested additional information regarding the purpose or necessity of the \"Special Committee\" referenced in the December 9 Communication. After an additional follow-up on December 11, 2024, the \"Special Committee\" communicated that such a committee was permissible because it was ad hoc in nature and had no executive authority (i.e., that it was essentially powerless).\n\nAfter receiving no feedback from the Board regarding the December 5 Proposal, the Reporting Persons submitted the December 16 Proposal.\n\nDespite prior questions and representations received regarding the power of the \"Special Committee,\" the presence and \"authority\" of the \"Special Committee\" continued to be asserted when the Reporting Persons received an outright rejection of the December 16 Proposal without including the full Board on its communication. Moreover, the supposed \"rejection\" of the December 16 Proposal by the \"Special Committee\" purports to be an exercise of power reserved to the Company's Board by a \"Special Committee\" that had previously represented it lacked executive authority.\n\nThe Reporting Persons sent a letter to the Board inquiring, among other things, as to the authority granted to the Special Committee. On January 17, 2025, legal counsel (Mr. Grossman's brother from Skadden, Arps) contacted counsel to the Reporting Persons confirming that Skadden, Arps had been retained by the \"Special Committee.\"\n\nAs a result of the actions of the \"Special Committee\" and its clear material breach of the Agreement, counsel for the Reporting Persons sent a letter to the Board on January 21, 2025 (\"January 21 Communication\") informing the Board of the material breach. Under the terms of the Agreement, a material breach that is incapable of being cured terminates the Agreement. As a result of the termination, the Reporting Persons are also no longer obligated to the terms of the Agreement. In addition to communicating the breach of the Agreement, the January 21 Communication made a books and records request under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\nAs a result of this series of events, the Reporting Persons sent an open letter to shareholders of the Company. A copy of this letter is filed hereto as Exhibit 99.1.\n\nGiven restrictions under the Agreement have lifted as of the date of filing of this Amendment No. 34 and given the Agreement has been terminated as a result of a material breach by the Company and the Board of its terms, a material breach that is not capable of being cured, the Reporting Persons are free to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. The Reporting Persons hereby affirm that they have no current intent to engage in a control transaction.\n\nTo the extent the Company continues to refuse nomination of directors proposed by the Reporting Persons, Ned L. Sherwood, MRMP-Managers LLC and Ned L. Sherwood Revocable Trust intend to make a filing with the SEC of a proxy statement and accompanying proxy card to solicit votes for the election of director nominees at the next annual meeting of shareholders of Barnwell Industries, Inc.\n\nNed L. Sherwood Revocable Trust, of which Ned L. Sherwood is the beneficiary and the trustee, holds 238,038 shares of common stock of Barnwell, and MRMP-Managers LLC, of which Mr. Sherwood is the Chief Investment Officer, holds 2,767,995.138 shares of common stock of Barnwell. Mr. Sherwood is deemed to beneficially own all of these shares. Ned L. Sherwood, NLS Advisory Group, Inc., MRMP-Managers LLC and their nominees to the Barnwell board will be the participants in this proxy solicitation.

(the \"Master Confirmation\"), enabling the execution by Low Tide of prepaid variable share forward transactions with Citibank, N.A., with respect to shares of common stock of the Issuer (\"Shares\") owned by Low Tide, subject to the execution of supplemental confirmations and related pricing notices for each forward transaction, pursuant to the terms of the Master Confirmation.  As of the date hereof, Low Tide owns 382,292 Shares.\n\n     On January 21, 2025 (the \"Trade Date\"), Low Tide and Citibank, N.A. entered into two transactions (each, a \"Transaction\", and together, the \"Transactions\"), under the Master Confirmation, pursuant to which Low Tide agreed to sell to Citibank, N.A. an aggregate of 328,292 Shares.  Subject to certain conditions, Low Tide can elect to instead settle the Transactions by cash payment, pursuant to the Master Confirmation, and thereby retain full ownership of the Shares pledged in connection therewith.\n\n     Under the terms of the Master Confirmation, Low Tide may, at its election, subject to certain terms and conditions, receive prepayments from Citibank, N.A. with respect to some or all portions of each Transaction, equal to the present value as of the relevant funding date of the payment of the respective Floor Price (as defined below) at maturity of such Transaction.  Each Transaction has one component (the \"Component\").  For each Transaction, Low Tide is obligated to deliver to Citibank, N.A. on the settlement date (the \"Settlement Date\") that is approximately 18 months after the Trade Date 164,146 Shares (the \"Number of Shares\") or, subject to certain conditions, an equivalent amount of cash. For each Transaction, if prepayment with respect to the Component has been paid to Low Tide by Citibank, N.A., Citibank, N.A. will pay to Low Tide  an amount equal to the Number of Shares for the Component multiplied by (a) if the per-share volume weighted average price of the Shares on the related valuation date (the \"Settlement Price\") is less than or equal to a floor price that will be determined following a hedging period (the \"Floor Price\"), zero; (b) if the Settlement Price is between the Floor Price and a cap price that will be determined following a hedging period (the \"Cap Price\"), the Settlement Price minus the Floor Price; and (c) if the Settlement Price is greater than the Cap Price, the Cap Price minus the Floor Price.  For each Transaction, if prepayment with respect to the Component has not been paid to Low Tide by Citibank, N.A., Citibank, N.A. will pay to Low Tide an amount equal to the Number of Shares for the Component multiplied by (a) if the Settlement Price is less than or equal to the Floor Price, the Floor Price; (b) if the Settlement Price is between the Floor Price and the Cap Price, the Settlement Price; and (c) if the Settlement Price is greater than the Cap Price, the Cap Price.\n\n     In connection with each Transaction, Low Tide will pledge the Number of Shares to Citibank pursuant to the Master Confirmation to secure its obligations under each Transaction.  Low Tide retains economic rights and voting rights to such Shares while they are subject to the pledge (so long as no event of default or similar event occurs under the Master Confirmation).  The aggregate Number of Shares for both Transactions represents approximately 0.3 % of the outstanding Shares, based on 116,667,564 Shares disclosed by the Issuer as outstanding as of November 29, 2024, and 5,115,961 exchangeable shares of Lulu Canadian Holding, Inc., which shares are exchangeable for an equal number of shares of the Issuer's common stock disclosed by the Issuer as outstanding as of November 29, 2024.\n\n     Low Tide entered into the Transactions for purposes of providing financial flexibility in support of ongoing investments.  Because the Master Confirmation entitles Low Tide to exercise its discretion to elect to settle the Transactions in cash, the Master Confirmation permits Low Tide to effectively retain ownership of the Shares subject to the Transactions, and, if the Transactions are ultimately settled in cash, to participate in all future stock price appreciation.\n\n     The Master Confirmation described in this Item 6 of this Schedule 13D is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 of this Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference into this Item 6.\n\n     In connection with the transfer of shares to Low Tide disclosed in Item 5(c) of this amendment, the credit line of Low Tide with RBC Dominion Securities Inc., dated as of May 18, 2023 and as previously disclosed in the amendment to Schedule 13D filed May 19, 2023, was reinstated.  A copy of the credit line agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 of this Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference into this Item 6."}

Subsequent to the 2022 annual meeting, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve notified us that it would not object to our request to purchase additional shares of the Issuer up to 14.9%, and subsequent to the 2024 annual meeting, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve notified us that it would not object to our request to purchase additional shares of the Issuer up to 19.9%.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, pursuant to Mississippi law, we served a demand for inspection of the Issuer's books and records related to, among other things, reported losses and the employee(s) responsible for the losses associated with the Issuer's securities portfolio. When the Issuer refused to permit the inspection of its books and records, we filed, on July 22, 2022, a complaint in the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi to compel the production of those books and records. After four Harrison County judges recused themselves, the Mississippi Supreme Court appointed a retired judge from Hinds County, Mississippi as Special Chancellor to hear our books and records demand case against the Issuer. On July 18, 2023, the Special Chancellor partially granted our motion for summary judgment and ordered the Issuer to produce most of the records we sought in our books and records demand.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, we demanded that the Issuer pursue a derivative action against its directors for breach of their fiduciary duties for failure to oversee and properly supervise management of the company. On September 29, 2023, we filed a derivative complaint on behalf of the Issuer against the Issuer's directors in the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, for breach of fiduciary duty, seeking damages and other remedies. On December 19, 2024, the Chancery Court issued its order denying the Issuer's directors' motion to dismiss and ordering discovery to move forward. On January 9, 2025, the Issuer filed an interlocutory appeal from the Chancery Court's order to the Mississippi Supreme Court. On January 24, 2025, we opposed. We are seeking in excess of $50 million in restitution to the Issuer from the Issuer's directors.\n\nOur purpose in acquiring shares of Common Stock of the Issuer is to profit from the appreciation in the market price of the shares of Common Stock through asserting shareholder rights.

Pursuant to the previously disclosed Securities Purchase Agreement, upon each draw under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Issuer will issue and sell to CCM Denali Equity in private placement transactions Warrants and/or Preferred Stock in amounts representing predetermined, fully diluted, percentages (an \"Applicable Percentage\") of Common Stock. Upon any failure to achieve a milestone, in addition to not being able to receive a draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan unless waived by the Lenders, the Applicable Percentage will be subject to up to a 4.0% increase for all milestone events as to each of the remaining milestone measurement dates.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the Issuer and Cerberus Capital Management II mutually confirmed that the Issuer satisfied all four applicable performance objectives comprising the third milestone required to draw an additional $40.5 million on the Delayed Draw Term Loan (the \"Third Milestone\") related to the Issuer's automated production line, materials costs, Z3 technology performance and backlog/cash conversion, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

Holders of the Series B-4 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends or distributions on each share of Series B-4 Preferred Stock equal to dividends or distributions actually paid on each share of Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\n\nIn the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuer, the holders of the Series B-4 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Issuer pro rata with the holders of the Common Stock and any other holders of the preferred stock of the Issuer issued pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, including the Series B-4 Preferred Stock (the \"Investor Preferred Stock\"), in an amount equal to such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series B-4 Preferred Stock been converted to Common Stock.\n\nUnder the terms of the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation, at all times when the holders of the Investor Preferred Stock beneficially own at least 10% of the capital stock of the Issuer (subject to adjustment as indicated in the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation), such holders of Investor Preferred Stock of the Issuer, exclusively and voting together as a separate class, will have the right to appoint one director to the board of directors of the Issuer (the \"Board\").

At all times when holders of the Investor Preferred Stock beneficially own at least 30% of the capital stock of the Issuer (subject to adjustment as indicated in the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation), such holders of the Investor Preferred Stock, exclusively and voting together as a separate class, will have the right to appoint a third director to the Board. At all times when holders of the Investor Preferred Stock beneficially own at least 40% of the capital stock of the Issuer (subject to adjustment as indicated in the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation), such holders of the Investor Preferred Stock, exclusively and voting together as a separate class, will have the right to nominate and designate a fourth director, who shall be designated by the Board or the nominating committee of the Board to a class of common directors and stand for election as a common director on the Board; provided that, the nominating committee of the Board determines that such appointment of the fourth director would not result in a change of control under any Issuer governing documents or applicable law or violate any applicable laws, including requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Series B-1 Certificate of Designation, the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation, the Series B-3 Certificate of Designation, and the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation, any such fourth director appointment shall be subject to and conditioned upon compliance by the holders of the Investor Preferred Stock with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods.  In the event that any such fourth director is not approved by the stockholders of the Issuer at the applicable annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of record of the shares of Investor Preferred Stock will have the right to appoint and elect a replacement for such director, pursuant to the approval requirements set forth above. To the extent any of such directors qualify to serve on any committees of the Board, for each such committee for which at least one director is qualified, such director will be invited to serve on such committee of the Board. So long as the holders of the Investor Preferred Stock have a right to appoint a director, the holders thereof will be entitled to appoint a non-voting observer to the Board. At all times when the holders of Investor Preferred Stock have a right to appoint a director, the holders of Investor Preferred Stock shall not vote any shares of Common Stock they receive upon the conversion of any Investor Preferred Stock or the exercise of any Warrants in any election of directors.\n\nAt any time after January 24, 2030, the outstanding shares of Series B-4 Preferred Stock held by any holder become redeemable for cash at the redemption price. The redemption price will be an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the B-4 Original Issue Price, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, up to and including the date of redemption and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable Series B-4 Preferred Stock multiplied by the average of the closing sale price of the Common Stock for the five business days immediately prior to the date of redemption plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, up to and including the date of redemption. Subject to certain excluded issuances, the Series B-4 Preferred Stock is subject to anti-dilution protection in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion.\n\nUntil the later of (i) such time when the holders of Investor Preferred Stock shall no longer beneficially own at least 5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Issuer and (ii) January 24, 2030, the Investor Preferred Stock shall have certain other protective provisions including, among others, limiting the ability of the Issuer to perform any of the following without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of the Investor Preferred Stock: (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the Issuer or effect any event that requires a distribution to the Issuer's stockholders in accordance to their liquidation preference, or any other merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance; (ii) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Issuer in a manner that adversely affects the special rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the Investor Preferred Stock (or any series thereof); (iii) create or issue or obligate itself to issue shares of, or reclassify, any capital stock other than Excluded Issuances (as defined in the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation); (iv) increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Investor Preferred Stock, or create any additional class or series of capital stock of the Issuer (other than increases in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock); or (v) purchase or redeem (or permit any subsidiary to purchase or redeem) or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, any shares of capital stock of the Issuer other than (a) redemptions of or dividends or distributions on the Investor Preferred Stock as expressly authorized therein or in the certificate of designation of any Investor Preferred Stock, and (b) dividends or other distributions payable on the Common Stock solely in the form of additional shares of Common Stock.\n\nThe Series B-4 Certificate of Designation also contains preemptive rights to participate in certain future equity offerings by the Issuer. If the Issuer proposes to offer or sell any New Securities (as defined in the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation), the Issuer shall first offer such New Securities to the holders of the Series B-4 Preferred Stock. The holder shall be entitled to participate in such offering of New Securities on a pro rata basis, determined by dividing (i) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, on an as-converted basis, held by such holder, by (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the time of such offering plus the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, on an as-converted basis.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Series B-4 Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Issuer's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 27, 2025, and is incorporated herein by reference.", "item6_contracts_arrangements": "Item 6 is hereby amended and supplemented by the addition of the following:\n\nThe disclosure in Item 4 is incorporated herein by reference."}
