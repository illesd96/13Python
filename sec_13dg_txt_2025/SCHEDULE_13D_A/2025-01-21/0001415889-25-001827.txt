It is accordingly agreed that NB, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (the &#147;<u>Moving Party</u>&#148;), shall each be entitled to specific enforcement of, and injunctive relief to prevent any violation of, the terms hereof, and the other Party hereto will not take action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to the Moving Party seeking such relief on the grounds that any other remedy or relief is available at law or in equity. This <u>Section 6</u> is not the exclusive remedy for any violation of this Agreement.</p>
