<commentText>EXPLANATORY NOTE&#13;
&#13;
This Amendment No. 6 (this "Amendment No. 6") is being filed by the undersigned to amend and supplement the Schedule 13D originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 23, 2022 (as amended, from time to time, the "Schedule 13D") relating to the common shares, without par value (the "Common Shares"), of Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (the "Issuer"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D.</commentText>
</item1>
<item4>
<transactionPurpose>Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby supplemented as follows: &#13;
&#13;
On January 16, 2025, the Reporting Persons received from the Issuer a calculation setting forth the adjustment to the conversion prices for outstanding secured and unsecured notes held by Glencore Canada Corporation following the closing of an underwritten public offering of securities by the Issuer. As a result, in accordance with the terms of the applicable notes, the conversion price for the $116,551,170.40 original principal amount note of the A&amp;R Glencore Convertible Notes ("A&amp;R Convertible Note No. 1") had been adjusted to $2.35, the conversion price for the $114,615,632.00 original principal amount note of the A&amp;R Glencore Convertible Notes ("A&amp;R Convertible Note No. 2") had been adjusted to $50.25 and the New Note Conversion Price for the Senior Secured Convertible Note had been adjusted to $3.05, each subject to future adjustments in accordance with the terms of the applicable notes.</transactionPurpose>
</item4>

As of such date, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to have shared power to vote, direct the vote, dispose of or direct the disposition of (and therefore beneficially own), an aggregate of 82,447,356 Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Senior Secured Convertible Note and A&amp;R Glencore Convertible Notes directly owned by Glencore Canada Corporation, including accrued but unpaid interest through January 21, 2025, plus 7,423 Common Shares previously awarded to Mr. Kunal Sinha under the Issuer's 2021 Incentive Award Plan. This amount of Common Shares represents approximately 69.8% of the outstanding Common Shares and is calculated based on 35,603,217 Common Shares of the Issuer outstanding as of as of January 16, 2025 (such outstanding shares based on information provided to the Reporting Persons by the Issuer), plus the 82,447,356 Common Shares of the Issuer issuable to Glencore Canada Corporation upon conversion of all of the Senior Secured Convertible Note and A&amp;R Glencore Convertible Notes directly owned by Glencore Canada Corporation including accrued but unpaid interest through January 21, 2025. Mr. Sinha is the Global Head of Recycling at the Glencore group and holds the securities reported herein for the benefit of the Reporting Persons, and will, after vesting, if applicable, transfer the securities directly to the Reporting Persons. As of the date hereof, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the A&amp;R Glencore Convertible Notes and Senior Secured Convertible Note is $245,831,872.79 (inclusive of PIK interest) and $81,573,643.75 (inclusive of PIK interest), respectively.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
