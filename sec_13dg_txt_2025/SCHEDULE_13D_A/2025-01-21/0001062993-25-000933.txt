				<fundsSource>Funds for the purchase of the Common Shares were derived from the subscription proceeds from investors and the capital appreciation thereon and margin account borrowings made in the ordinary course of business.  In such instances, the positions held in the margin accounts are pledged as collateral security for the repayment of debit balances in the account, which may exist from time to time.  Since other securities are held in the margin accounts, it is not possible to determine the amounts, if any, of margin used to purchase the Common Shares reported herein. A total of approximately $444,856,136 was paid to acquire the Common Shares reported herein.</fundsSource>
