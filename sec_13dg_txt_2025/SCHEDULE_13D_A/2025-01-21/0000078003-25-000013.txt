International plc, HSBC Bank plc, BNP PARIBAS, Mizuho International plc and UBS AG London Branch, as the lead managers (the "Lead Managers"), and the additional managers named therein (together with the Lead Managers, the "Managers"), pursuant to which the Lead Managers agreed, severally and not jointly or jointly and severally, to use their respective reasonable endeavors to procure purchasers for 580,000,000 Ordinary Shares (or such higher number as agreed between Pfizer and the Lead Managers) at a price to be determined pursuant to an accelerated book building process (the "January 2025 Secondary Offering"), and the Managers excluding the Lead Managers agreed, severally and not jointly or jointly and severally, to act as co-managers in connection with the January 2025 Secondary Offering.  Pursuant to the terms of sale dated January 15, 2025 (the "Terms of Sale"), 700 million Ordinary Shares were sold at a price of 357 pence (approximately $4.36 at the pricing of the January 2025 Secondary Offering) per Ordinary Share.

The January 2025 Secondary Offering closed on January 17, 2025.

Pursuant to the January 2025 Block Trade Agreement, Pfizer undertook that it would not, and would procure that the members of its Group (as defined therein) would not, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option over or otherwise dispose of any equity securities of the Issuer or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, equity securities of the Issuer, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period beginning on January 14, 2025 and ending 60 days after the closing of the January 2025 Secondary Offering, subject to certain exceptions.

The foregoing descriptions of the January 2025 Block Trade Agreement and the Terms of Sale do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual terms of such agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3 to Amendment No. 11 and are incorporated by reference herein.</contractDescription>
