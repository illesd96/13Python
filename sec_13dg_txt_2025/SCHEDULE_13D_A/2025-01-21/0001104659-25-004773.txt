        <commentText>This Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to Schedule 13D amends the initial statement on Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons on March 5, 2021, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed by the Reporting Persons on January 28, 2022 (as so amended, the "Schedule 13D"), relating to the Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"), of SmartKem, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment No. 2 shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D.</commentText>
      </item1>
      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The information contained in Item 5(a) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

The aggregate number and percentage of the class of securities identified pursuant to Item 1 beneficially owned by each Reporting Person is stated in Item 11 and Item 13 on the cover pages hereto.

Since Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D was filed by the Reporting Persons on January 28, 2022, there have been no acquisitions or dispositions by the Reporting Persons of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. The number of shares held by the Reporting Persons decreased solely as a result of a reverse stock split of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-35, effective September 21, 2023 (the "Reverse Stock Split").

In addition, several issuances by the Issuer had a dilutive effect on the Reporting Persons' respective beneficial ownership percentages. In particular, the Reporting Persons' beneficial ownership percentages were materially reduced as a result of (i) the January 26, 2024 conversion of 4,220 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, stated value $1,000 per share (the "Series A-1 Preferred Stock"), of the Issuer into 482,293 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer (the "Conversion"), resulting in 1,371,961 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer outstanding following the Conversion, and (ii) two concurrent private placement offerings of the Common Stock of the Issuer which closed on December 20, 2024 (the "Private Placements"), resulting in a total of 3,562,173 shares of the Issuer outstanding following the closings.

The foregoing descriptions of the Reverse Stock Split, the Conversion, and the Private Placements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Issuer's Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed September 20, 2023, January 29, 2024, and January 8, 2025, respectively, each of which are incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 99.6, 99.7 and Exhibit 99.8 to this Schedule 13D, respectively.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>The information contained in Item 5(b) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

(b) Number of shares as to which each Reporting Person has:

(i) sole power to vote or to direct the vote:

See Item 7 on the cover pages hereto.

(ii)  shared power to vote or to direct the vote:

See Item 8 on the cover pages hereto.

(iii)  sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of:

See Item 9 on the cover pages hereto.

(iv)  shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition of:

See Item 10 on the cover pages hereto.</numberOfShares>
        <transactionDesc>The information contained in Item 5(c) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

The Reporting Persons have not effected any transactions in the Common Stock of the Issuer during the past sixty days or since the most recent filing of Schedule 13D, whichever is less.</transactionDesc>
      </item5>
      <item7>
        <filedExhibits>Item 7 is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

Exhibit 99.6 - Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 19, 2023, filed by the Issuer with the SEC on September 20, 2023.

Exhibit 99.7 - Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 26, 2024, filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 29, 2024.
