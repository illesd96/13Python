        <commentContent>The shares reported in rows 7, 9 and 11 in the table above represent 2,000,000 shares of Series I Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Class I Shares"), of Goldman Sachs Real Estate Finance Trust Inc, a Maryland corporation (the "Issuer") held by KREI West St. Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("KREI West St.").

The percentage reflected in row 13 in the table above is calculated using 4,665,897 shares of Common Stock (as defined below) outstanding as of January 6, 2025, as set forth in the Issuer's current report on Form 8-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 17, 2025. The Issuer registered its Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Common Stock") pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The Issuer has four different authorized series of Common Stock which the Issuer views as being part of the same single class of Common Stock. However, in order to mirror common industry terminology, the Issuer refers to its four separate series of Common Stock as four different "classes", specifically, as "Series T", "Series S", "Series D" and "Series I".

        <commentText>EXPLANATORY NOTE - This Amendment No. 1 (this "Amendment No. 1") amends the initial Schedule 13D filed on January 14, 2025 (the "Initial Schedule 13D" and, together with this Amendment No. 1, the "Schedule 13D") relating to the Series I Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Class I Shares"), of Goldman Sachs Real Estate Finance Trust Inc, a Maryland corporation (the "Issuer"). Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment No. 1 does not modify any of the information previously reported in the Initial Schedule 13D. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment No. 1 shall have the same meanings herein as are ascribed to such terms in the Initial Schedule 13D. This Amendment No. 1 is being filed jointly by KREI West St. Investments, LLC ("KREI West St."), KREI Investment Holdings, LLC ("KREI Investment"), Koch Real Estate Investments, LLC ("Koch Real Estate"), Koch Investments Group, LLC ("KIG"), Koch Investments Group Holdings, LLC ("KIGH"), Koch Companies, LLC ("KCLLC"), and Koch, Inc. (each a "Reporting Person," and collectively, the "Reporting Persons"). Koch, Inc., KCLLC, KIGH, KIG, Koch Real Estate, and KREI Investment may be deemed to beneficially own the Class I Shares held by KREI West St. by virtue of (i) Koch, Inc.'s beneficial ownership of KCLLC, (ii) KCLLC's beneficial ownership of KIGH, KIGH's beneficial ownership of KIG, KIG's beneficial ownership of Koch Real Estate, Koch Real Estate's beneficial ownership of KREI Investment, and KREI Investment's beneficial ownership of KREI West St.

This Amendment No. 1 is being filed solely to update the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer and update the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer reported as beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons in the Initial Schedule 13D, to reflect revised numbers disclosed by the Issuer in an amended current report on Form 8-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 16, 2025, and not as a result of any transaction in the securities of the Issuer.
