        <commentText>This Amendment No. 1 ("Amendment No. 1") amends and supplements the statement on Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 1, 2024 (the "Original Schedule 13D" and together with this Amendment No. 1, the "Schedule 13D"). This Amendment No. 1 amends and supplements Items 4 and 6 and amends and restates Item 5(a)-(c) and (e) as set forth below. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Amendment No. 1 have the meanings set forth in the Schedule 13D.</commentText>
      </item1>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>In accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement (described in the Original Schedule 13D), the Issuer Parties filed the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court on September 24, 2024, and filed a Chapter 11 plan (the "Plan") with the Bankruptcy Court on December 20, 2024. On December 20, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan.

The Plan became effective in accordance with its terms on January 21, 2025 (the "Effective Date"), and the Issuer Parties emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases.

On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, all shares of Common Stock, all warrants to purchase the Common Stock, and any other equity-based instruments, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, and any rights of any holder in respect thereof, were deemed cancelled, released, extinguished, and of no further force or effect.

Also in accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, the obligations under the Restructuring Support Agreement and under the DIP Loan Agreement of the parties signatories thereto were cancelled.

Following the consummation of the transactions that occurred on January 21, 2025, any "group" that may be deemed to have existed between the Reporting Person and the other parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement has been terminated.

Pursuant to the Plan and following the cancellation of the Common Stock on the Effective Date, the reorganized company issued new common equity interests ("New Common Stock") to holders of Allowed DIP Claims (as defined in the Plan) and Allowed Term Loan Claims (as defined in the Plan), including the Reporting Person.  The New Common Stock is not registered under, nor convertible into equity registered under, Section 12(b) or (g) of the Act and, accordingly, ownership of such New Common Stock is not subject to reporting under Section 13(d) or (g) of the Act.</transactionPurpose>

      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>See rows (11) and (13) of the cover page to this Schedule 13D for the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock and percentages of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Person.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>See rows (7) through (10) of the cover page to this Schedule 13D for the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Reporting Person has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the vote and sole or shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition.</numberOfShares>
        <transactionDesc>Except as described in Item 4, the Reporting Person has not effected transactions in the shares of Common Stock during the past sixty (60) days.</transactionDesc>
        <date5PercentOwnership>January 21, 2025.</date5PercentOwnership>
      </item5>
      <item6>
        <contractDescription>The information set forth in Item 4 of this Amendment No. 1 is incorporated herein by reference.

In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, the previously reported warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,114,707 shares of Common Stock held by the Highbridge Funds were deemed cancelled, released, extinguished, and of no further force or effect.</contractDescription>
