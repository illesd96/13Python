Flynn, a natural person ("Flynn" and, collectively with Deerfield Mgmt III, Deerfield Private Design Fund III, Deerfield Mgmt, Deerfield Partners and Deerfield Management, the "Reporting Persons"), as amended by Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 thereto (as previously amended, the "Schedule 13D"), with respect to the common stock of Acutus Medical, Inc (the "Company"). Deerfield Private Design Fund III and Deerfield Partners are collectively referred to herein as the "Deerfield Funds".

      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended to add the following:

In furtherance of the discussions held with respect to the Specified Restructuring Transactions and related wind down initiatives, on January 21, 2025, the Deerfield Funds and the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 ("Amendment No. 5") to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was amended to facilitate the implementation of further restructuring and related wind down initiatives. The effectiveness of the Amendment No. 5 is conditioned on, among others, (1) filing of a form 15 with the SEC for the purpose of effecting a termination of the registration of the Company's securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and (2) the payment by the Company of a warrant termination fee equal to $250,000 in the aggregate, in U.S. dollars, to terminate and cancel the Deerfield Funds' right to purchase up to (i) an aggregate 3,779,018 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share at an exercise price of $1.1114 per share (ii) an aggregate 209,996  shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share at an exercise price of $16.67 per share and (iii) an aggregate 224,118  shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share at an exercise price of $.097 per share, pursuant to a Warrant Termination Agreement between the Company and the Deerfield Funds on January 21, 2025 ("Warrant Termination Agreement"). In connection with the Warrant Termination Agreement and the related transactions, the Company and the Deerfield Funds also entered into a Registration Rights Termination Agreement on January 21, 2025, which will terminate the Registration Rights Agreement upon the effectiveness of Amendment No. 5 ("Registration Rights Termination Agreement"). Upon satisfaction of the conditions to effectiveness of Amendment No. 5, all warrants beneficially owned by the Deerfield Funds will be cancelled. Additionally, in connection with Amendment No. 5, the Company and the Deerfield Funds entered into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement on January 21, 2025, which provides the issuance, to each Deerfield Fund, for its own ratable account, of a consent fee in the form of a contingent value rights agreement, representing in aggregate the right to receive cash payments equal to the lesser of (i) $300,000 and (ii) 5% of the aggregate amount of total value that would otherwise be available to equityholders of the Company upon satisfaction of certain conditions ("Contingent Value Rights Agreement").</transactionPurpose>
