        <transactionPurpose>The reporting person has acquired Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (ATDS) shares for investment purposes, believing the company to be undervalued based on its current market price relative to its potential.

The reporting person intends to monitor the company's performance closely and may discuss potential strategic alternatives, operational improvements, and corporate governance enhancements with management, the board of directors, or other shareholders. These discussions include, but are not limited to, exploring options for improving the company's financial position, enhancing its product offerings, and strengthening its market presence. The reporting person reserves the right to increase or decrease their position in the company's securities, depending on market conditions and other factors. Currently, the reporting person has no immediate plans or proposals that would result in any of the transactions or changes contemplated in Item 4 of Schedule 13D but may consider such actions in the future if deemed necessary to protect or enhance shareholder value.</transactionPurpose>
