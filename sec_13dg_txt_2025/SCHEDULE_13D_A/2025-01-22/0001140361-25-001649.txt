&#13;
Also in accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, the obligations of the RSA Parties under the Restructuring Support Agreement and under the DIP Loan Agreement were cancelled.&#13;
&#13;
Following the consummation of the transactions that occurred on January 21, 2025, any "group" that may be deemed to have existed between the Reporting Persons and the other parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement has been terminated.</transactionPurpose>
