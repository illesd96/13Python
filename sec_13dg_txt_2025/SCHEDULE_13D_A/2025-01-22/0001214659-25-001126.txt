        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 is amended and restated as follows:

The Reporting Persons purchased the shares of Common Stock for investment purposes, and such purchases have been made in the ordinary course of business of the Reporting Persons.

In pursuing such investment purposes, the Reporting Persons may further purchase, hold, vote, trade, dispose, or otherwise deal in the Common Stock at times, and in such manner, as they deem advisable to benefit from, among other things, (1) changes in the market prices of the shares of Common Stock; (2) changes in the Issuer's operations, business strategy, or prospects; or (3) from the sale or merger of the Issuer. To evaluate such alternatives, the Reporting Persons will closely monitor the Issuer's operations, prospects, business development, management, competitive and strategic matters, capital structure, and prevailing market conditions, as well as other economic, securities markets, and investment considerations. Consistent with their investment research methods and evaluation criteria, the Reporting Persons have in the past discussed, and may in the future discuss, such matters with the management or Board of Directors of the Issuer (the "Board"), other stockholders, industry analysts, existing or potential strategic partners or competitors, investment and financing professionals, sources of credit, and other investors. Such evaluations and discussions may materially affect, and result in, among other things, the Reporting Persons (1) modifying their ownership of the Common Stock; (2) exchanging information with the Issuer pursuant to appropriate confidentiality or similar agreements; (3) proposing changes in the Issuer's operations, governance, or capitalization; or (4) pursuing one or more of the other actions described in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

In addition to the information disclosed in this Statement, the Reporting Persons reserve the right to (1) formulate other plans and proposals; (2) take any actions with respect to their investment in the Issuer, including any or all of the actions set forth in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D; and (3) acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose of some or all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them, in each case in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise.

On January 17, 2025, the Issuer announced the appointment of Mr. James Geygan to its Board of Directors.

On January 17, 2025, GVIC issued a press release concerning the appointment of Mr. James Geygan to the Issuer's Board of Directors. The press release is attached as Exhibit 3 and is incorporated into this Item 4 by reference.</transactionPurpose>
