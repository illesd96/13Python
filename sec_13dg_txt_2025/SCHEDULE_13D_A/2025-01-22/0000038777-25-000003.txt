Each subscriber is required to make capital contributions to purchase the Shares each time the Issuer delivers a drawdown notice, to be delivered at least ten business days prior to the required funding date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed their respective Capital Commitments. All purchases will generally be made pro rata in accordance with the Capital Commitments, at a per-share price as determined by the Board of Trustees of the Issuer in accordance with the limitations under Section 23 of the 1940 Act(which generally prohibits the Issuer from issuing Shares at a price below the then-current net asset value of the Shares as determined within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays, of such issuance (taking into account any investment valuation adjustments from the latest quarterly valuation date in accordance with the Issuer's valuation policy, subject to certain exceptions); provided that the Issuer retains the right to make non-pro rata capital drawdowns for any reason in the Issuer's sole discretion, including, without limitation, if the Issuer determines that it is necessary or advisable in light of applicable legal, tax, regulatory and other considerations, such as to comply with Section 12d(1) of the 1940 Act or the ownership limits as set forth in the Issuer's Declaration of Trust. As set forth in each Subscription Agreement, in the event that there is a failure to pay all or any portion of a drawdown purchase price pursuant to a drawdown notice, and such default remains uncured for a period of thirty days, the Issuer will be permitted to pursue any remedies against the defaulting subscriber available under the Subscription Agreement or at law or at equity, including prohibiting the defaulting subscriber from purchasing additional Shares or causing the defaulting subscriber to forfeit 50% of the defaulting subscriber's Shares to the other shareholders.

The obligation to purchase additional Shares will be released on the earlier of (i) the date that a Capital Commitment is fully called and (ii) the 18-month anniversary of the initial closing date under the Subscription Agreement, except to the extent deemed necessary by the investment advisor to the Issuer to preserve or enhance the value of the Issuer's existing investments.

The Issuer may, at any time, and without further notice to or consent from any subscriber, grant security over, and, in connection therewith, transfer its right to draw down capital from any subscriber, and the Issuer's right to receive the drawdown share purchase price (and any related rights of the Issuer), to lenders or other creditors of the Issuer, in connection with any indebtedness, guarantee or surety of the Issuer.

The Shares may not be transferred unless they are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption from such registration thereunder is available.</contractDescription>

Exhibit B: Item 5 Ownership

FRI is filing this report for itself and its affiliates. FRI and its investment management subsidiary, FAV, may be deemed to beneficially own the Shares for which FAV is the investment adviser pursuant to investment management contracts that grant investment and/or voting power to FAV for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"). When an investment management contract (including a sub-advisory agreement) delegates to FAV investment discretion or voting power over the securities held in the investment advisory accounts that are subject to that agreement, FRI treats FAV as having sole investment discretion or voting authority, as the case may be, unless the agreement specifies otherwise.

Beneficial ownership by FRI and its affiliates is being reported herein in conformity with the guidelines articulated by the SEC staff in Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998) (the "1998 Release ") relating to organizations, such as FRI, where related entities exercise voting and investment powers over the securities being reported independently from each other. The voting and investment powers held by each of FRI's affiliates whose ownership of securities is disaggregated from that of FRI in accordance with the 1998 Release ("FRI Disaggregated Affiliates") are exercised independently from FRI and from all other investment management subsidiaries of FRI (FRI, its affiliates and the investment management subsidiaries of FRI other than FRI Disaggregated Affiliates are collectively, "FRI Aggregated Affiliates").  Furthermore, internal policies and procedures of, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates, and, on the other hand, FRI, establish informational barriers that prevent the flow among, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates (including preventing the flow between such entities), and, on the other hand, the FRI Aggregated Affiliates, of information that relates to the voting and investment powers over the securities owned by their respective investment management clients. Consequently, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates report the securities over which they hold investment and voting power separately from the FRI Aggregated Affiliates for purposes of Section 13 of the Act.

C. Johnson and R. Johnson, Jr. (the "Principal Shareholders") may each own in excess of 10% of FRI's outstanding common stock and are the principal stockholders of FRI (see FRI's Proxy Statement-Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners).  The Principal Shareholders may be deemed to be, for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Act, the beneficial owners of securities held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of FRI.  FRI, the Principal Shareholders, and FAV disclaim any pecuniary interest in any of the Shares reported herein.  In addition, the filing of the Schedule 13D on behalf of FRI and the Principal Shareholders should not be construed as an admission that any of them is, and each disclaims that it or he is, the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3, of any of the Shares.

FRI, FAV, and the Principal Shareholders believe that they are not a "group" within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Act and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the beneficial ownership of the Shares held by any of them.</filedExhibits>
