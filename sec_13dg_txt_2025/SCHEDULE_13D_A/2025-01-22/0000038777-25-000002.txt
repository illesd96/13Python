Exhibit B: Item 5 Ownership

Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. ("BSP"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of FRI, serves as investment Adviser to the Issuer. BSP holds no Shares and no Class A Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Issuer.

FRI is filing this report for itself and its affiliates, except as set forth herein. Beneficial ownership by FRI and its affiliates is being reported herein in conformity with the guidelines articulated by the SEC staff in Release
No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998) (the "1998 Release ") relating to organizations, such as FRI, where related entities exercise voting and investment powers over the securities being reported independently from each other. The voting and investment powers held by each of FRI's affiliates whose ownership of securities is disaggregated from that of FRI in accordance with the 1998 Release ("FRI Disaggregated Affiliates") are exercised independently from FRI and from all other investment management subsidiaries of FRI (FRI, its affiliates and the investment management subsidiaries of FRI other than FRI Disaggregated Affiliates are collectively, "FRI Aggregated Affiliates").  Furthermore, internal policies and procedures of, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates, and, on the other hand, FRI, establish informational barriers that prevent the flow among, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates (including preventing the flow between such entities), and, on the other hand, the FRI Aggregated Affiliates, of information that relates to the voting and investment powers over the securities owned by their respective investment management clients. Consequently, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates report the securities over which they hold investment and voting power separately from the FRI Aggregated Affiliates for purposes of Section 13 of the Act.

C. Johnson and R. Johnson, Jr. (the "Principal Shareholders") may each own in excess of 10% of FRI's outstanding common stock and are the principal stockholders of FRI (see FRI's Proxy Statement-Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners).  The Principal Shareholders may be deemed to be, for purposes of Rule 13d 3 under the Act, the beneficial owners of securities held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of FRI.  FRI, the Principal Shareholders, and FAV disclaim any pecuniary interest in any of the Shares reported herein.  In addition, the filing of the Schedule 13D on behalf of FRI and the Principal Shareholders should not be construed as an admission that any of them is, and each disclaims that it or he is, the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3, of any of the Shares.

FRI, HoldCo, FAV, and the Principal Shareholders believe that they are not a "group" within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Act and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the beneficial ownership of the Shares held by any of them.  HoldCo did not acquire more than 5% of the Issuer's outstanding Shares until October 3, 2022.</filedExhibits>
