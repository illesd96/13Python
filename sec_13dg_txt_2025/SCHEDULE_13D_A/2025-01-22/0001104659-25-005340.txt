        <commentContent>As described in the definitive proxy statement filed by Astrana Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, 2024, pursuant to a Voting and Registration Rights Agreement between the Issuer and Allied Physicians of California, a Professional Medical Corporation, a California professional corporation (the "Reporting Person"), entered into on September 11, 2019, any vote by the Reporting Person in excess of 9.99% of the Issuer's then-outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share ("Common Stock"), will be voted by proxy given to the Issuer's management, and that proxy will cast the excess votes in the same proportion as all other votes cast on the matter by the Issuer's stockholders. Accordingly, the Reporting Person has sole voting power with respect to 5,589,677 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 9.99% of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and shared voting power with respect to the remaining 1,243,021 shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Person.

The percentage calculation is based on 56,252,730 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of November 6, 2024 (which includes shares held by the Reporting Person, which are treated by the Issuer as treasury shares for accounting purposes), minus 300,000 shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Issuer from the Reporting Person on January 17, 2025.</commentContent>

The Reporting Person acquired the Common Stock reported in this Statement for investment purposes. The Reporting Person may in the future acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose of some or all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by it in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, on such terms and at such times as it may deem advisable. The Reporting Person may engage in hedging or similar transactions with respect to the shares of Common Stock, on such terms and at such times as the Reporting Person may deem advisable, subject to applicable law.

The Reporting Person does not have any present plan or proposal that would result in any of the actions described in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, except as set forth herein or as may be proposed by officers or directors of the Reporting Person in their capacity as an officer and/or director of the Issuer or by the Board of Directors of the Issuer with their participation. The Reporting Person reserves the right in the future to formulate any such plans or proposals, and to take any actions with respect to its investments in the Issuer, including any or all of the actions described in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.</transactionPurpose>
      </item4>
      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The Reporting Person beneficially owns in the aggregate 6,832,698 shares of Common Stock, which represents approximately 12.2% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock.

        <numberOfShares>The Reporting Person beneficially owns, and has the sole and shared power to direct the voting and disposition of, the shares of Common Stock disclosed as beneficially owned by it in the table set forth on the cover page to this Statement.</numberOfShares>

The information set forth in Item 4 of this Amendment is incorporated herein by reference.

On November 18, 2024, Kenneth Sim, the Chairman and a director and stockholder of the Reporting Person, and the Executive Chairman of the Issuer's Board of Directors, exercised options to purchase 28,046 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $18.65 per share.</transactionDesc>
