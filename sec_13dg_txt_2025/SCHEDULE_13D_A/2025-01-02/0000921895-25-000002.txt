On December 30, 2024, the Reporting Person delivered a letter (the "Letter") to the Issuer's board of directors (the "Board"), and issued a press release including a full copy of the Letter. In the Letter, the Reporting Person stated that the best option for the Issuer and its shareholders is to commence a strategic alternatives process and pursue opportunities to fix the Issuer under the umbrella of a larger organization or in the private markets.  The Reporting Person noted, if a financial buyer provides the best opportunity, the Issuer should consider transaction structures that would enable existing stakeholders to participate in a transaction and maintain or increase their interests in the Issuer, which the Reporting Person would be willing to do. The Reporting Person thanked the Board for its engagement with the Reporting Person, expressed its appreciation that the Board believes everything is on the table to maximize shareholder value, and reiterated its wish to continue constructive engagement with the Board.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Fund 1 Investments LLC (together with its affiliates,
&ldquo;Fund 1&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) beneficially owns approximately 10.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Vera Bradley,
Inc. (&quot;Vera Bradley&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), and has economic exposure of 20.0% of the outstanding shares, making us the
Company's largest shareholder.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As we described to you over the phone, Fund 1
is a global long/short equity firm that makes both public and private investments primarily focused on the consumer, telecom, media, and
technology sectors. We possess significant retail expertise and have a long history of constructively engaging with management teams and
boards to offer value-enhancing ideas, introductions to relevant executives, and capital for strategic initiatives to our portfolio companies.
We encourage you to speak with executives from other companies that we have invested in to understand the valuable insight we endeavor
to bring and how we strive to approach each situation with humility and level-headedness.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We thank you and appreciate the time you spent
with us the other week as we have the utmost respect for you and the beloved brand your family has built over the past 40 years. As we
have conducted substantial research on the Company over the past few years, we can&rsquo;t help but admire Barb&rsquo;s vision and tenacity
- to build a business from scratch that, at its peak, generated ~$550 million of annual revenue is inspiring and representative of the
American Dream. Barb&rsquo;s designs were iconic globally and the Vera Bradley name has been synonymous with innovation and disruption
for decades. The Company and its products have a truly remarkable legacy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We, as your largest shareholder, simply want Vera
Bradley to return to its winning ways. In its first year of being public, Vera Bradley generated $366 million of revenue and nearly $50
million of free cash flow, translating into a $1.5 billion enterprise value company. Today, analysts expect $380 million of revenue &ndash;
essentially the same topline as when the Company IPO&rsquo;d. Except, that same $360+ million of revenue is expected to burn cash and
that $1.5 billion enterprise value implies negative value today, adjusted for the acquisition of Pura Vida<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Company is now experiencing a perfect storm
&ndash; i) a history of value destruction and questionable capital allocation, ii) poor recent operational performance, iii) a failed
brand turnaround, iv) extremely negative macro sentiment for fashion brands, and v) a less than $60 million of public float. As you well
know, thriving as a microcap company in today&rsquo;s public markets is near impossible. <B>It is clear to us that the best option for
Vera Bradley and its shareholders is to commence a strategic alternatives process and pursue opportunities to fix the Company under the
umbrella of a larger organization or in the private markets. We were pleased to hear the Board of Directors believes everything is on
the table to maximize shareholder value and we are highly supportive of this.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>We believe Vera Bradley can be a much more
valuable company and has a timely opportunity to return to its winning ways.</B> If the Company were out of the public spotlight, there
are many advantages for Vera Bradley: i) ability to focus on the brand revival without quarterly earnings, ii) cost savings opportunities
unavailable in the public markets, and iii) more time for management to focus on the business as opposed to frequent meetings with shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>We believe that a strategic or financial buyer
would be able to complete a transaction at an attractive premium for shareholders. If a financial buyer provides the best opportunity,
the Company should consider transaction structures that would enable existing stakeholders to participate in a transaction and maintain
or increase their interests in the Company, which we would be willing to do. </B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As we discussed the other week, we wish to continue
to have a constructive engagement with you and are available to discuss the contents of this letter at your convenience.</P>
