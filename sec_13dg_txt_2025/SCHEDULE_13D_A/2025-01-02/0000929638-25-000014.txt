<commentText>This Amendment No. 11 to Schedule 13D (this "Amendment"), which is being filed voluntarily, relates to Class A Common Stock of Tilly's, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer" or the "Company").  The address of the principal executive offices of the Issuer is 10 Whatney, Irvine, California 92618.  This Amendment is being filed by the Reporting Person to amend the Schedule 13D that was filed on March 15, 2023, as amended on April 4, 2023, April 28, 2023, June 2, 2023, June 6, 2023, December 4, 2023, January 11, 2024, February 2, 2024, March 4, 2024, March 19, 2024 and July 3, 2024 (as amended, the "Schedule 13D").  Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the Schedule 13D.&#13;
&#13;
This amendment is being filed to amend and supplement Items 5(a) through 5(c) and Item 6 of the Schedule 13D.</commentText>
</item1>
<item5>
<percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5(a) is hereby amended and restated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
See Items 7-13 of the cover page.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
<numberOfShares>Item 5(b) is hereby amended and restated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
See Items 7-13 of the cover page.</numberOfShares>
<transactionDesc>Item 5(c) is hereby amended and restated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
The Reporting Persons did not effect any transactions in shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock during the sixty day period prior to this filing.&#13;
&#13;
The percentage calculations herein are based upon the statement in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended November 2, 2024, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2024, that there were 22,845,799 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer outstanding as of December 4, 2024.</transactionDesc>
</item5>
<item6>
<contractDescription>Item 6 is hereby amended and restated as follows: &#13;
&#13;
Between December 26 and 31, 2024, the Reporting Person entered into certain cash-settled swap agreements with an unaffiliated third-party financial institution (the "Cash-Settled Swaps"). Collectively, the Cash-Settled Swaps held by the Reporting Person represent economic exposure to an aggregate of 513,885 notional shares of Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer. The Cash-Settled Swaps provide the Reporting Person with economic results that are comparable to the economic results of ownership, but do not provide it with the power to vote or direct the voting, or dispose of or direct the disposition, of the shares that are subject to the Cash-Settled Swaps.&#13;
&#13;
Other than as described herein, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships between the Reporting Person and any other person, with respect to the securities of the Issuer.</contractDescription>
