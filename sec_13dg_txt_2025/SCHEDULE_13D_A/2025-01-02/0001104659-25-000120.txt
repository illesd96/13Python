The information set forth in Items 2, 3 and 6 of this Schedule 13D and the cover pages of this Schedule 13D is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 5.

(a)-(b) The responses of each Reporting Person to rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 of the cover pages of this Schedule 13D are hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 5.

As of the date hereof, (i) 34,702,890 Class B ordinary shares are held directly by Traveler Enterprise Limited, (ii) 2,730,370 Class A ordinary shares represented by American Depositary Shares are beneficially owned by Traveler Enterprise Limited, (iii) 1 Class A ordinary share is held by Medway Brilliant Holding Limited and (iv) Mr. Jiayuan Lin holds options to purchase up to 14,882,970 Class A ordinary shares exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof.

The percentage of the class of securities beneficially owned is calculated based on (i) 135,751,299 Class A ordinary shares of the Issuer issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024, as provided by the Issuer, (ii) 34,702,890 Class B ordinary shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons, assuming the conversion of all such Class B ordinary shares into the same number of Class A ordinary shares and (iii) 14,882,970 Class A ordinary shares that Mr. Jiayuan Lin has the right to acquire within 60 days after the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the options granted to him, assuming such options were exercised, as applicable.

The voting power of the shares beneficially owned by Mr. Jiayuan Lin represents 44.2% of the total outstanding voting power. The percentage of voting power is calculated by dividing the voting power beneficially owned by such reporting person by the voting power of (i) a total of 135,751,299 Class A ordinary shares and 72,978,677 Class B ordinary shares of the Issuer issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024, as provided by the Issuer, as well as (ii) 14,882,970 Class A ordinary shares that Mr. Jiayuan Lin has the right to acquire within 60 days after the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the options granted to him, assuming such options were exercised.

Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof. Class A ordinary shares are not convertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances.

In addition to the Special Option Grant, as described further in Item 6 below, the Issuer granted certain options to purchase Class A ordinary shares to Mr. Jiayuan Lin pursuant to the Issuer's 2018 share incentive plan (the "2018 Plan").

However, neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that the Reporting Persons are members of any such group. Each Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of the Class A ordinary shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned solely by virtue of the voting agreement.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
