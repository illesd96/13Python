        <fundsSource><![CDATA[Item 3 of the Original 13D is hereby amended to add the following paragraphs below:

On and effective on September 16, 2022, the Issuer, Lubbock Energy Partners LLC; Banner Oil & Gas, LLC; Woodford Petroleum, LLC; Llano Energy LLC; Synergy Offshore LLC; King Oil & Gas Company, Inc.; WDM Family Partnership, LP; and Katla Energy Holdings LLC, entered into an Amended and Restated Nominating and Voting Agreement (the "A&R Agreement"). The A&R Agreement amended and restated a prior Nominating and Voting Agreement dated January 5, 2022, to include King Oil, WDM and Katla Energy as voting parties thereunder (each a "Voting Party") and clarify the Issuer's change in domicile from Wyoming to Delaware.

The A&R Agreement provides that each of Lubbock, Synergy and Banner (each a "Nominating Party") has the right to designate for nomination to the Board of Directors of the Issuer (the "Board") two nominees (for so long as such Nominating Party (and its affiliates) beneficially owns at least 15% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock) and one nominee (for so long as such Nominating Party (and its affiliates) beneficially owns at least 5% of the Issuer's Common Stock), for appointment at any stockholder meeting or via any consent to action without meeting of the stockholders of the Issuer. The A&R Agreement also requires the Board to include such nominees in the slate of directors up for appointment at each meeting of stockholders where directors will be appointed, and take other actions to ensure that such persons are elected to the Board by the stockholders of the Issuer.

The A&R Agreement also provides that for the purposes of calculating the percentage ownership of Common Stock beneficially held by each Nominating Party, shares of Common Stock may only be counted once, and may only be deemed beneficially owned by at a maximum, by one Nominating Party and that further, in the event any shares of Common Stock are beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Rule 13d-3") by more than one Nominating Party, such affected Nominating Parties shall apportion beneficial ownership for the purposes of the A&R Agreement equitably, in good faith, and promptly advise the Issuer and the other Nominating Parties of such agreed allocations.

Pursuant to the A&R Agreement, if any Nominating Party's nominated party ceases for any reason to serve on the Board, such nominated party will be provided the right to appoint another person to the Board, who shall be appointed to the Board pursuant to the power to fill vacancies given to the Board without a stockholder vote, by the Bylaws of the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the above, no person is required to be included as a nominee for election or appointment to the Board in the event such person is a Disqualified Person. A "Disqualified Person" is a person for whom the Board reasonably determines that the nomination, election or appointment of, or retention of such person on the Board, as applicable, would (a) violate the listing rules of Nasdaq or the rules and regulations of the SEC, (b) due to such person's past, affiliations or otherwise, negatively affect the reputation of the Issuer, negatively affect the Issuer's ability to complete future transactions, or disqualify the Issuer from undertaking any offering under applicable securities laws, or (c) violate the fiduciary duties that the Board owes to the Issuer or its stockholders; provided, however, that if the Board reasonably determines that any person is unfit for service on the Board for the reasons set forth above, then the applicable Nominating Party is entitled to designate an alternative or replacement person.

Further notwithstanding the above, the non-Nominating Party directors and Nominating Party directors are required to be apportioned between 'independent' and non-'independent' directors as required by the rules of Nasdaq such that the Issuer continues in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules.

Each nominated person is entitled to the same expense reimbursement and advancement, exculpation, indemnification and insurance in connection with his or her role as a director as the other members of the Board, as well as reimbursement for documented, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board or any committee of the Board of which such nominated person is a member, if any, in each case to the same extent as the other members of the Board. The Issuer also agreed to continue to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage with respect to each nominated person's service on the Board for a period of at least six years after each such nominated person's service on the Board has concluded.

At all times when Lubbock holds at least 5% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock and its appointee is John A. Weinzierl, each Nominating Party is required to instruct its appointee on the Board to vote in favor of appointing Mr. Weinzierl as Chairman of the Board.

During the term of the A&R Agreement, each Nominating Party and each Voting Party, agreed to vote all securities of the Issuer which they hold in any manner as may be necessary to nominate and elect (and, if applicable, maintain in office) as a member of the Issuer's Board, each of the nominated persons and further to not remove any nominated persons, unless such person is a Disqualified Person.

The A&R Agreement continues in effect until the earlier of (a) the date mutually agreed by each of the Nominating Party; and (b) the date that no Nominating Party owns at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer; subject to certain rights and obligations which survive termination. Once a Nominating Party's ownership drops below 5% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock, it no longer has any right to nominate any person under the A&R Agreement, even if such Nominating Party's ownership increases above 5% of the Issuer's Common Stock in the future. Each Voting Party ceases to be bound by the terms of the A&R Agreement at such time as the Voting Party no longer holds any shares of Common Stock of the Issuer.

On January 27, 2025, the Issuer entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with Banner, Woodford and Sage Road Energy (the "Selling Stockholders").

Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement, the Company, in a private transaction, outside of, and separate from the Company's previously disclosed share repurchase program, on January 27, 2025, repurchased (a) 534,020 shares of Common Stock held by Banner, (b) 41,229 shares of Common Stock held by Woodford, and (c) 60,151 shares of Common Stock held by Sage Road, for an aggregate of $1,574,362 or $2.47775 per share, which is the price per share of the 4,871,400 shares Common Stock which the Issuer sold in its underwritten public offering which closed on January 23, 2025, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and which represents an 8.2% premium to the closing sales price of the Issuer's Common Stock on January 27, 2025.]]></fundsSource>
