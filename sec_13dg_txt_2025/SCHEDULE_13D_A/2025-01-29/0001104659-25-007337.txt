        <commentContent>Note to Row 7: John C. Malone ("Mr. Malone") together with Terence F. McGuirk ("Mr. McGuirk") may be deemed to constitute a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Act on account of the Malone Voting Agreement and the Malone LLC Operating Agreement. Mr. Malone expressly disclaims membership in such a group.

Note to Rows 7, 9, and 11: Includes 47,585 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc.'s (the "Issuer") Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Common Stock") held in a revocable trust (the "LM Revocable Trust") with respect to which Mr. Malone and Mr. Malone's wife, Mrs. Leslie Malone ("Mrs. Malone"), are trustees. Mrs. Malone has the right to revoke such trust at any time. Mr. Malone disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares held by the LM Revocable Trust.

Note to Rows 7, 9, and 11: Includes 887,079 shares of Series B Common Stock held in a revocable trust (the "JM Revocable Trust") with respect to which Mr. Malone is trustee. Mr. Malone has the right to revoke such trust at any time.

Note to Row 7: Includes 887,079 shares of Series B Common Stock held by a limited liability company of which Mr. Malone is a member and which Mr. McGuirk has the sole power to direct the voting with respect to Included Matters pursuant to the Malone Voting Agreement and which Mr. Malone has the sole power to direct the voting with respect to all other matters.

Note to Rows 8, 10, and 11: Includes 10,868 shares of Series B Common Stock held by two trusts (the "Trusts") which are managed by an independent trustee (and, in the case of one such Trust, also co-managed by one of Mr. Malone's adult children) and of which the beneficiaries are Mr. Malone's adult children. Mr. Malone has no pecuniary interest in the Trusts, but he retains the right to substitute assets held by the Trusts. Mr. Malone disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares held by the Trusts.

Note to Row 13: Calculated based upon the 977,776 shares of Series B Common Stock outstanding as of October 31, 2024, as reported by the Issuer in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 7, 2024. Each share of Series B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes, whereas each share of the Issuer's Series A Common Stock (the "Series A Common Stock") is entitled to one vote. Accordingly, Mr. Malone may be deemed to beneficially own voting equity securities of the Issuer representing approximately 48.2% of the voting power with respect to a general election of directors of the Issuer, calculated based on 10,318,162 shares of Series A Common Stock and 977,776 shares of Series B Common Stock  outstanding as of October 31, 2024, as reported by the Issuer in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 7, 2024. See Item 5.

This Amendment No. 2 to the Schedule 13D relates to two series of Common Stock, the Series A Common Stock and the Series B Common Stock. Due to technical limitations of only being able to enter nine alpha numeric characters on the facing sheet of this Amendment No. 2, we are filing two versions of this Amendment No. 2 that amend the same Schedule 13D. The first relates to the Series A Common Stock (CUSIP: 047726104). The second relates to the Series B Common Stock (CUSIP: 047726203).</commentContent>

        <transactionPurpose>The information contained in Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended to delete the last two paragraphs thereof and supplemented to include the following information:

Mr. Malone intends to continue to review his investment in the Issuer on an ongoing basis and, depending on various factors, including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position, the price of shares of Common Stock, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions, Mr. Malone may, in the future, take such actions with respect to his shares of Common Stock as he deems appropriate, including, without limitation, purchasing additional shares of Common Stock which could result in Mr. Malone holding more than a majority of the voting equity securities of the Issuer. In addition, from time to time, Mr. Malone may dispose of all or a portion of the securities of the Issuer owned by him.

If Mr. Malone holds more than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Issuer, the Issuer may be deemed to be a "Controlled Company," as defined in Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If Mr. Malone held a majority of the voting securities of the Issuer, he would have the ability, subject to the rules of Major League Baseball and the Voting Agreement,  to control, or exert a significant influence over, the board of directors of the Issuer (the "Board") and would have significant influence over its affairs, including with respect to the consummation of significant corporate transactions, amendments of the Issuer's articles of incorporation, a merger or other sale of the Issuer or its assets, and all matters requiring shareholder approval.

Other than as described above or as described in that certain Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Issuer on August 23, 2024, Mr. Malone does not have any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (i) any acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer, or any disposition of securities of the Issuer; (ii) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the Board or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any vacancies on the Board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; (vi) any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure; (vii) any change in the Issuer's charter or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person; (viii) any delisting from a national securities exchange or any loss of authorization for quotation in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association of a class of securities of the Issuer; (ix) any termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of a class of equity securities of the Issuer; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.</transactionPurpose>
