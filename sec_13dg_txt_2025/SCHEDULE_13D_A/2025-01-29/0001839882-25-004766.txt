        <contractDescription>Item 6 of the Amended Schedule 13D is amended and restated in its entirety, as follows:

The information set forth in Items 4 and 5 hereof, as amended from time to time, is incorporated into this Item 6 by reference, as applicable.

From time to time, JS Capital enters into loan facilities with certain bank lenders, which are secured by pledges of portfolios of securities held by JS Capital, including but not limited to shares of Class A Stock. Repayment under such facilities is due at term; however, upon the occurrence of certain events, such payment obligations may be accelerated and the lender could take action with respect to any collateral. Currently, JS Capital is party to one such loan facility pursuant to which it may draw  up to $250 million secured by a pledge of portfolios of securities, including 29,549,512 shares of Class A Stock. JS Capital may also pledge these or additional shares of Class A Stock to lenders under this or other similar facilities.

As reported by the Issuer in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 29, 2025, the Issuer has entered into an agreement (the "Amazon Agreement") with Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon") pursuant to which, among other things, Issuer has agreed to issue to a subsidiary of Amazon a warrant (the "Amazon Warrant") to purchase  shares of the Issuer's Class A Stock (the "Amazon Warrant Shares"), subject to approval by the Issuer's stockholders of the issuance of the Amazon Warrant and the Amazon Warrant Shares. In connection with the Amazon Agreement, and pursuant to the Support Agreement (the "Support Agreement") dated as of January 28, 2025 by and among the Issuer, Amazon and JS Capital, JS Capital has agreed to vote in favor of the issuance of the Amazon Warrant and the Amazon Warrant Shares at any stockholders' meeting held by the Issuer for the purpose of approving the issuance of the Amazon Warrant and the Amazon Warrant Shares prior to June 30, 2026 (or earlier termination of the Amazon Agreement or the Support Agreement) and has granted to the Issuer an irrevocable proxy to vote the shares of Class A Stock held by JS Capital in connection therewith. In connection with this voting agreement, JS Capital has also agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer or enter into any other voting arrangement with respect to any shares of Class A Stock held by it during this period (subject to limited exceptions). In connection with the Support Agreement, JS Capital also has agreed to waive any right that it might otherwise have under the Registration Rights Agreement described in Item 4 hereof to be included in a registration statement filed by the Issuer in connection with the Amazon Warrant Shares. The Support Agreement is attached to this Schedule 13D as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated by reference herein.

The Reporting Persons are parties to an agreement with respect to the joint filing of this Schedule 13D and any amendments thereto.  A copy of such agreement is attached to this Schedule 13D as Exhibit 1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Other than as set forth above and the agreements discussed in Items 4 and 5, the Reporting Persons have no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with any persons with respect to securities of the Issuer.</contractDescription>

or to an Affiliate of Stockholder, or if Stockholder is a trust, a transfer to a beneficiary, <I><U>provided</U></I>, that in each such

filing of a Form 4 reporting such transfer, (4) transfers to another holder of the capital stock of the Company that has signed a voting
agreement in substantially the form hereof, and (5) transfers, sales or other dispositions as Amazon may otherwise agree in writing in
its sole discretion. If any voluntary or involuntary transfer of any Shares covered hereby shall occur (including a transfer or disposition
permitted by <U>Section 4(1)</U> through <U>Section 4(5)</U>, sale by a Stockholder&rsquo;s trustee in bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser
at any creditor&rsquo;s or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent
transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under
this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding that such transferee is not a Stockholder and has not
executed a counterpart hereof or joinder hereto. Nothing in this Section 4 shall prevent (i) the Stockholder from maintaining any prime
brokerage or other lending arrangement with any financial institution on the List of Global Systemically Important Banks, as published
by The Financial Stability Board from time to time, as a result of which any Shares or any New Shares are pledged as collateral or are
otherwise encumbered in support of such arrangement (each such arrangement, a &ldquo;<U>Lending Arrangement</U>&rdquo;) or (ii) any party
to such Lending Arrangement exercising is rights under, or remedies with respect to, such Lending Arrangement. Stockholder covenants
that, in the event of an actual default or notice of a non-curable event of default under any Lending Arrangement, Stockholder will provide
prompt written notice (but in any event within three business days) of such default or such notice to both Amazon and the Company, and
Stockholder will use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate, at Amazon&rsquo;s request, one or more meetings with Stockholder,
the Company, and the applicable Lending Arrangement counterparty or counterparties.</FONT></P>
