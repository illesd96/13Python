The Board&rsquo;s recent decision to double down on a broken status quo, after already subjecting shareholders to years of <U>systemic

                                            to shareholder pressure was to make a long overdue CEO change. But by replacing the CEO with
                                            his &lsquo;right hand&rsquo; COO, a 17-year veteran and long-time senior Lamb Weston executive,
                                            the Board demonstrated its continued failure to recognize the magnitude of changes required

                                            to shirk accountability for the self-inflicted missteps that have led to substantial share
                                            losses, which we believe to be the primary driver of Lamb Weston&rsquo;s significant volume
                                            declines and large performance gap to North American peers (who we believe are operating
                                            at higher capacity utilization). After previously trying to blame its self-induced volume
                                            losses on restaurant traffic, on the December call the departing CEO once again strained
                                            credulity &ndash; citing potential <I><U>future</U></I> competitor capacity additions to
                                            normalize <I><U>current and ongoing</U></I> underperformance. After spending billions in
                                            shareholder capital to expand capacity and acquire its European joint venture &ndash; while
                                            at the same time voluntarily walking away from customers &ndash; the Company now claims ignorance
                                            regarding potential competitor capacity additions, despite their multi-year lead time and
                                            evidence to the contrary. The Board&rsquo;s approval of this disingenuous presentation of
                                            the facts &ndash; presumably in a bid to save itself from blame &ndash; only adds to the

have revealed a staggering level of frustration and loss of confidence in Lamb Weston&rsquo;s Board and leadership. We summarize below
the feedback from roughly 70% of the top 70 Lamb Weston shareholders who participated in an independent shareholder perception study.
These views &ndash; both quantitative and qualitative &ndash; loudly echo what investors have told us directly. <B>While the ratings
for nearly all key areas including leadership, operational execution and capital allocation were extremely weak, product quality stood
out in sharp contrast and was nearly a 10 &ndash; highlighting how severely the Company has squandered its leading market position and
