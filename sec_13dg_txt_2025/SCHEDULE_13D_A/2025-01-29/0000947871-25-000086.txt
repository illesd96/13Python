        <fundsSource>On December 31, 2024, the Issuer closed an offering (the "Offering") of (i) Class A Units ("Class A Units"), each Class A Unit consisting of one Share or one Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase one Share (a "Pre-Funded Warrant") and one Series A Warrant to purchase one Share (a "Series A Warrant"), and (ii) Class B Units ("Class B Units"), each Class B Unit consisting of one Pre-Funded Warrant. The aggregate purchase price per Share and Series A Warrant was $5.103 and the aggregate purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant and Series A Warrant was $5.093.

The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $0.01 and will become exercisable upon stockholder approval of the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, in accordance with Nasdaq listing rules. The Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire.

The Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $13.42 and will become exercisable on June 30, 2025; provided however, that the Series A Warrants may not be exercised prior to the Issuer's receipt of stockholder approval of the exercise of the Series A Warrants, in accordance with Nasdaq listing rules. The Series A Warrants expire on the date that is the earlier of (i) December 31, 2029, and (ii) subject to the fulfilment of certain equity conditions, thirty trading days after the last of the following data readouts to occur, as announced by the Issuer: (a) Ferret animal model Bird Flu data, (b) non-human primate Bird Flu data, or (c) Phase 2a Influenza A human clinical data.

In connection with the Offering, OrbiMed Private Investments VIII, LP ("OPI VIII"), a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, purchased 96,348 Class A Units for an aggregate purchase price of $490,700. The source of funds for such purchases was the working capital of OPI VIII.</fundsSource>

        <transactionPurpose>The Reporting Persons from time to time intend to review their investment in the Issuer on the basis of various factors, including the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuer's Shares in particular, as well as other developments and other investment opportunities. Based upon such review, the Reporting Persons will take such actions in the future as the Reporting Persons may deem appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time. If the Reporting Persons believe that further investment in the Issuer is attractive, whether because of the market price of Shares or otherwise, they may acquire Shares or other securities of the Issuer either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Similarly, depending on market and other factors, the Reporting Persons may determine to dispose of some or all of the Shares currently owned by the Reporting Persons or otherwise acquired by the Reporting Persons either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons have not formulated any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of securities of the Issuer, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (e) any material change in the Issuer's capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer, (f) any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure, (g) any change in the Issuer's charter or bylaws or other instrument corresponding thereto or other action which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person, (h) causing a class of the Issuer's securities to be deregistered or delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, (i) a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.</transactionPurpose>

      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The following disclosure is based upon 3,650,731 outstanding Shares of the Issuer, as set forth in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on November 13, 2024, and includes an additional 155,293 Shares subject to presently convertible shares of the Issuer's Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock").

As of the date of this filing, OPI VIII, a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, holds 605,531 Shares constituting approximately 16.6% of the issued and outstanding Shares and beneficially owns an additional 155,293 Shares (on an as-converted basis) subject to presently convertible shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which, together with the Shares held by OPI VIII, constitutes 19.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares. OPI VIII holds 1,682.3473 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, inclusive of the 155,293 Shares (on an as-converted basis) subject to presently convertible shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are deemed to be beneficially owned for purposes of this Amendment No. 2. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into 400 Shares, subject to an issuance limitation that prohibits the holder from converting such shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the extent that after giving effect to the issuance of Shares after such conversion, the holder (together with the holder's affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 19.9% of the Shares outstanding. Additionally, OPI VIII holds 96,348 Pre-Funded Warrants and 96,348 Series A Warrants.

OrbiMed GP is the general partner of OPI VIII, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OPI VIII, and OrbiMed Advisors is the managing member of OrbiMed GP, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of OrbiMed GP. As a result, OrbiMed Advisors and OrbiMed GP share power to direct the vote and disposition of the Shares held by OPI VIII and may be deemed directly or indirectly, including by reason of their mutual affiliation, to be the beneficial owners of the Shares, Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants, and Series C Preferred Stock held by OPI VIII. OrbiMed Advisors exercises this investment and voting power through a management committee comprised of Carl L. Gordon, Sven H. Borho, and W. Carter Neild, each of whom disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares, Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants, and Series C Preferred Stock held by OPI VIII.</percentageOfClassSecurities>

Support Agreement

In connection with the Offering, OPI VIII and certain other stockholders of the Issuer entered into support agreements with the Issuer (the "Support Agreement") whereby the stockholders agreed to vote their Shares outstanding as of the date of the Offering in favor of (i) the issuance of more than 19.99% of the Issuer's outstanding Shares upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants and (ii) the issuance of Shares to certain insiders of the Issuer upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants, each in accordance with the listing rules of Nasdaq.
