        <commentContent>The number in Row 7, 9, and 11 consists of (i) 1,398,111 ordinary shares, par value $0.003 per share ("Ordinary Shares"), of Chijet Motor Company, Inc. (the "Issuer") held by Chijet Holdings Limited ("CHL"), a reporting person, prior to the consummation of a private placement transaction on January 7, 2025, in which the Issuer issued Ordinary Shares and warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares (the "Warrants") to CHL and certain other investors (the "PIPE"), (ii) 339,286 Ordinary Shares issued to CHL in the PIPE, and (iii) 1,017,858 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants issued to CHL in the PIPE. The 1,398,111 Ordinary Shares held by CHL prior to the PIPE reflected (i) a 1-for-30 reverse stock split effectuated by the Issuer on June 28, 2024, and (ii) the surrender of 286,618 Ordinary Shares on or about September 25, 2024, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022 (as amended, the "BCA"), by and among the Issuer, Jupiter Wellness Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, Chijet Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company ("Chijet"), each of the referenced holders of Chijet's outstanding ordinary shares (collectively, the "Sellers", including CHL), Chijet Motor (USA) Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, which reduced the reporting person's Ordinary Shares of 50,541,864 then held by CHL as reported by the reporting person on its Schedule 13D filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 16, 2024 (the "Original 13D"). Mr. Hongwei Mu is the director of CHL and as such, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the foregoing securities held by CHL.

The percentage in Row 11 is calculated based on a denominator of 8,166,506 Ordinary Shares, consisting of (i) a total of 5,470,076 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024 as reported by the Issuer on the Condensed Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Issuer and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024 and for the Six Months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Issuer's Form 6-K as filed with the SEC on September 30, 2024 (the "6-K"), (ii) a total of 1,678,572 Ordinary Shares issued in the PIPE, as reported on the Issuer's Form 6-K as fined with the SEC on January 7, 2025, and (iii) 1,017,858 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants issued to CHL in the PIPE.</commentContent>

        <commentText>This Amendment No. 1 (this "Amendment") amends and supplements the Original 13D.

The purpose of this Amendment is to report that, (i) as certain earnout milestones provided in the BCA were not achieved for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023, 286,618 Ordinary Shares of CHL were surrendered to the Issuer and cancelled, and (ii) pursuant to certain securities purchase agreement dated January 5, 2025, by and between the Issuer and the purchasers identified therein, the Issuer issued and sold to CHL 339,286 Ordinary Shares and 1,017,858 Warrants, pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act contained in Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Regulations D and/or S thereunder.

Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment does not modify any of the information previously reported on the Original 13D. All disclosure in respect of items contained in the Original 13D where no new information is provided for such item in this Amendment is incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the same meanings ascribed thereto in the Original 13D.</commentText>
      </item1>
      <item3>
        <fundsSource>Pursuant to the BCA, certain number of Ordinary Shares reported in the Original 13D (the "Earnout Shares") that were acquired by the reporting persons in connection with the BCA is subject to an earnout (the "Earnout") which would adjust downwards the consideration certain Sellers who are earnout participants (the "Earnout Participants") receive by up to Six Hundred Seventy Four Million ($674 million) based on certain post-closing financial performance and stock price metrics of the Issuer, and all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the BCA.

Pursuant to the BCA, the Earnout Shares shall be issued and registered by the Issuer in the name of the Earnout Participants, but shall be unvested and subject to potential surrender and cancellation as provided in the BCA. Additionally, until the Earnout Shares have become vested, (i) all earnings, such as dividends or distributions, related to such Earnout Shares shall be held in a segregated escrow account (the "Escrow Account"), and (ii) the Earnout Participants will not be permitted to sell, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Earnout Shares (or any rights to the earnings thereon) (the "Earnout Transfer Restrictions"). Otherwise, the Earnout Shares shall have the same rights as the Ordinary Shares. Each of the Earnout Participants agrees that the Earnout Shares shall vest and no longer be subject to potential cancellation and become free of the Earnout Transfer Restrictions, and that each of the Earnout Participants shall have the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the earnings (such pro rata allocation based on the number of Purchased Shares (as defined in the BCA) owned by such Earnout Participant, divided by the total number of Purchased Shares owned by all Earnout Participants). The Earnout Shares will vest based on either meeting the criteria relating to (i) consolidated gross revenues or (ii) closing price of Ordinary Shares, and will vest in three tranches consisting of up to 30% for 2023, 30% for 2024 and any remaining unvested amount for 2025 (in each case without giving effect to any prior surrenders of Earnout Shares and together with any Earnings thereon (as defined in the BCA)), as described in the BCA.

As certain earnout milestones provided in the BCA were not achieved for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023, CHL surrendered a total of 286,618 Earnout Shares to the Issuer for cancellation.

Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 5, 2025, with CHL and certain other purchasers (the "Purchase Agreement"), the Issuer conducted a PIPE of an aggregate of 1,678,572 shares of Issuer's Original Shares and Warrants to purchase up to 5,035,716 shares of Issuer's Original Shares.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer agreed to issue and sell to CHL (i) 339,286 shares of Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $1.68, and (ii) Warrants to purchase up to 1,017,858 shares of Ordinary Shares at exercise price of $1 per share. As the director of CHL, Mr. Hongwei Mu has shared voting and investment power with respect to, and as such, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities held by CHL. The funds for the purchase of the Issuer equity came from the working capital of CHL contributed by its shareholder(s). The Warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in the Warrants), are exercisable on or after January 7, 2025 for three years. The Warrants contain standard adjustments to the exercise price, including without limitation, stock dividends, splits, reclassifications.

      <item5>

The 1,398,111 Ordinary Shares held by CHL prior to the PIPE reflected (i) a 1-for-30 reverse stock split effectuated by the Issuer on June 28, 2024, and (ii) the surrender of 286,618 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the BCA on or about September 25, 2024, which reduced the reporting person's Ordinary Shares of 50,541,864 then held by CHL as reported by the reporting person on the Original 13D.
