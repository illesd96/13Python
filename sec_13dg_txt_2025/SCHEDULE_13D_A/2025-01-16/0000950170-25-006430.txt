<commentText>This Amendment No. 6 to the joint statement on Schedule 13D with respect to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Natural Gas Services Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the "Issuer"), filed by Mill Road Capital III, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the "Fund"), Mill Road Capital III GP LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company and the sole general partner of the Fund (the "GP"), and Thomas E. Lynch (together with the Fund and the GP, the "Reporting Persons") on January 4, 2021, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed by the Reporting Persons on December 23, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 2 filed by the Reporting Persons on March 10, 2023, as amended by Amendment No. 3 filed by the Reporting Persons on May 2, 2023, as amended by Amendment No. 4 filed by the Reporting Persons on November 25, 2024, and as amended by Amendment No. 5 filed by the Reporting Persons on December 13, 2024 (such joint statement, as so amended and as amended herein, the "Schedule 13D"), amends the Schedule 13D as follows:</commentText>
</item1>
<item3>
<fundsSource>Item 3 of the Schedule 13D shall hereby be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

The Reporting Persons acquired beneficial ownership of an aggregate of 754,564 shares of Common Stock for $7,446,685.10 using working capital from the Fund and the proceeds of margin loans under margin loan facilities maintained in the ordinary course of business by the Fund with a broker on customary terms and conditions. The purchase price of shares acquired pursuant to the assignment of standard American-style, exchange-traded put options ("Put Options") is not reduced by the premium received by the Reporting Persons upon sale of the Put Options.</fundsSource>
</item3>
<item5>
<percentageOfClassSecurities>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of Item 5 of the Schedule 13D shall hereby be amended and restated in full as follows:

(a, b)	The percentages of beneficial ownership reported in this Item 5, and on each Reporting Person's cover page to this Schedule 13D, are based on a total of 12,474,020 shares of the Common Stock issued and outstanding as of November 8, 2024, as reported in the most recent quarterly report of the Issuer on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. All of the share numbers reported below, and on each Reporting Person's cover page to this Schedule 13D, are as of January 16, 2025, unless otherwise indicated.  The cover page to this Schedule 13D for each Reporting Person is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 5(a, b).

The Fund directly holds, and thus has sole voting and dispositive power over, 754,564 shares of Common Stock. The GP, as sole general partner of the Fund, also has sole authority to vote (or direct the vote of), and to dispose (or direct the disposal) of, these shares of Common Stock on behalf of the Fund, and Mr. Lynch has shared authority to vote (or direct the vote of), and to dispose (or direct the disposal) of, these shares on behalf of the GP. Accordingly, each of the Reporting Persons beneficially owns 754,564 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 6.0% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and the Reporting Persons beneficially own, in the aggregate, 754,564 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 6.0% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. Neither of Messrs. Petito nor Yanagi has beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
<transactionDesc>Paragraph (c) of Item 5 of the Schedule 13D shall hereby be amended and restated in full as follows:

(c)	Except as otherwise described in this Schedule 13D, no Reporting Person, other than the Fund as set forth in the table below, effected any transaction in shares of Common Stock during the period (the "Reporting Period") from December 13, 2024 (the date on which Amendment No. 5 to the Schedule 13D was filed) to January 16, 2025:
