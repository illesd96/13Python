The foregoing descriptions of the January 2025 Block Trade Agreement and the Terms of Sale do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual terms of such agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3 to this Amendment No. 11 and are incorporated by reference herein.</contractDescription>
