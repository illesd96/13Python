TERMINATION AGREEMENT
This Termination Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2025
(the 'Termination Agreement'), between Founders Software, Inc.,
 a Nevada corporation, having its principal place of business at
450 Corporate Parkway, Suite 100, Amherst, New York 14226 ('Founders'),
and Para Bellum Consulting, Inc., a New York corporation, having its
principal place of business at 2370 Lewis Road, South Wales,
New York 14139 ('Para Bellum,' and together with Founders,
the 'Parties,' and each, a 'Party').
WHEREAS, the Parties have entered into an Amended and Restated
Voting Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2024 (as amended,
amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from
time to time in accordance with its provisions, the 'Agreement');
WHEREAS, the Parties hereto desire to terminate the Agreement
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Agreement, the Parties
may not terminate the Agreement except by a writing signed by an
authorized Representative of each Party.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth
above and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:
1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this
Termination Agreement have the respective meanings assigned
to them in the Agreement.
2.Termination of the Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement is hereby terminated
as of the date first written above (the 'Termination Date').
From and after the Termination Date, the Agreement will be of
no further force or effect, and the rights and obligations of each of
the Parties thereunder shall terminate.
3.Mutual Release.
(a)In consideration of the covenants, agreements, and undertakings
of the Parties under this Termination Agreement, each Party, on behalf
of itself and its respective present and former parents, subsidiaries,
Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, members, successors,
and assigns (collectively, 'Releasors') hereby releases, waives,
and forever discharges the other Party and its respective present and
former, direct and indirect, parents, subsidiaries, Affiliates,
employees, officers, directors, shareholders, members, agents,
Representatives, permitted successors, and permitted assigns
(collectively, 'Releasees') of and from any and all actions,
causes of action, suits, losses, liabilities, rights, debts, dues,
sums of money, accounts, reckonings, obligations, costs, expenses,
liens, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies,
agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments,
extents, executions, claims, and demands, of every kind and
nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, suspected or unsuspected,
in law, admiralty, or equity (collectively, 'Claims'), which any of
such Releasors ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall, or
may have against any of such Releasees for, upon, or by reason
of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever from the beginning of time
through the date of this Termination Agreement arising out of or
relating to the Agreement, except for any Claims relating to rights
and obligations preserved by, created by, or otherwise arising out
of this Termination Agreement.
(b)Each Party, on behalf of itself and each of its respective
Releasors, understands that it may later discover Claims or facts
that may be different than, or in addition to, those that it or any
other Releasor now knows or believes to exist regarding the
subject matter of the release contained in this Section 3, and
which, if known at the time of signing this Termination Agreement,
 may have materially affected this Termination Agreement and
such Partys decision to enter into it and grant the release
contained in this Section 3. Nevertheless, the Releasors
intend to fully, finally and forever settle and release all Claims
that now exist, may exist or previously existed, as set forth in
the release contained in this Section 3, whether known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, or suspected or unsuspected, and the release
given herein is and will remain in effect as a complete release,
notwithstanding the discovery or existence of such additional
