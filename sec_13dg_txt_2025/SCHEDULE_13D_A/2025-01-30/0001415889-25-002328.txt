						<commentText>This Amendment No. 5 amends the Schedule 13D filed on June 30, 2021 (the "Original Schedule 13D") and the following amendments: No. 1 filed on September 9, 2021; No. 2 filed on July 25, 2022; No. 3 filed on February 15, 2024; and No. 4 filed on October 15, 2024. This statement of beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D relates to the Ordinary Shares of Nexxen International Ltd. (the "Issuer"), located at 82 Yigal Alon Street, Tel Aviv, Israel 6789124. Unless specifically amended hereby, the disclosures and statements set forth in the Original Schedule 13D and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 remain unchanged. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Original Schedule 13D. Since the filing of Amendment No. 4, the Issuer repurchased Ordinary Shares so that the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares reported by Issuer in a Press Release dated January 29, 2025 was 129,250,341. Through the Issuer's buy back of its shares, the Reporting Persons' percentage ownership of the Ordinary Shares has increased by approximately 1%.

Additionally, there is no CUSIP number assigned to the Ordinary Shares. The CUSIP number 89484T104 identified on the cover page for the Issuer has been assigned to the American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") of the Issuer, which are quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol "NEXN." Each ADS represents two (2) Ordinary Shares.  The Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.</commentText>
