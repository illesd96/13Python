        <commentContent>This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (this "Amendment No. 1") amends and supplements the Schedule 13D originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Leonard M. Tannenbaum (the "Reporting Person") with respect to Sunrise Realty Trust, Inc. (the "Issuer") on December 26, 2024 (the "Schedule 13D"). The Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented to include the information set forth herein. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Schedule 13D. Except as set forth herein, the Schedule 13D is unmodified.

Lines 7 and 9 consists of 2,434,213 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sunrise Realty Trust, Inc. held directly by the Reporting Person, including 91,238 shares of restricted stock held by the Reporting Person; and 1,000 shares of Common Stock held in a UTMA account for the son of the Reporting Person, for which the Reporting Person serves as custodian. Lines 8 and 10 consists of 420,181 shares of Common Stock held by the Tannenbaum Family Foundation formerly known as the Leonard M. Tannenbaum Foundation, for which the Reporting Person serves as the President and 58,958 shares of Common Stock held by Tannenbaum Family 2012 Trust for benefit of certain members of the Reporting Person's family, for which the Reporting Person serves as the Investment Advisor and Jeffrey Boccuzzi is a Co-Trustee; over which, in each case, the Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership. Excludes 33,132 shares of Common Stock held by Robyn Tannenbaum, the Reporting Person's spouse; over which the Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership.

Line 13 is based on 12,754,676 shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the issuance of 5,750,000 shares in the Issuer's public offering which closed on January 29, 2025, as reported in the Issuer's prospectus filed with the SEC on January 28, 2025.</commentContent>
