        <principalJob>This Schedule 13D is filed by Eagle Point Credit Management LLC ("EPCM"), a Delaware limited liability company (the "Reporting Person"). The principal business address for the Reporting Person is 600 Steamboat Road, Suite 202, Greenwich, CT 06830 United States.
EPCM is a registered investment adviser and serves as investment adviser to certain private funds and separately managed accounts which hold the Preferred Shares described herein (collectively, the "Accounts"). EPCM is ultimately wholly owned by Eagle Point Holdings LP ("EP Holdings") through intermediary holding companies. Eagle Point Holdings GP LLC ("EP Holdings GP") is the sole general partner of EP Holdings. EP Holdings GP is managed by a board of managers (the "EP Holdings Board") of which the majority of the members are appointed by Trident EP-II Holdings LLC ("EP-II LLC"), which also owns a majority of the voting interests in EP Holdings GP.
Information regarding EP Holdings, EP Holdings GP, EP-II LLC, and each member of the EP Holdings Board (the "Additional Disclosed Persons" and, together with the Reporting Person, the "Disclosed Parties") is attached to this Schedule 13D as Schedule I and is incorporated herein by reference.</principalJob>

      </item2>
      <item3>
        <fundsSource>Since the Reporting Persons' previous Schedule 13D filing relating to the Preferred Shares (filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024 and available at the following hyperlink: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1607203/000110465924027162/tm247183d1_sc13da.htm), all of the Preferred Shares reported herein were acquired over a period of time in multiple secondary transactions at various market prices. The funds used to acquire each of the Preferred Shares were from each applicable Account's available investment capital.</fundsSource>
      </item3>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>EPCM caused the Accounts to acquire the Preferred Shares they hold for investment purposes and will continue to analyze such investments on an ongoing basis. EPCM, on behalf of the Accounts, reserves the right to increase or decrease the Accounts' ownership of the Preferred Shares over time.</transactionPurpose>
      </item4>
      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Based on public disclosures filed by the Issuer with the SEC, the Issuer has total of 2,080,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Reporting Person may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 610,582 Series A Preferred Shares, which represents approximately 29.35% of all of the Issuer's outstanding preferred shares. The number of Preferred Shares which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Disclosed Parties are as follows:
