        <transactionPurpose>(a) and (b). The shares of Series B-1 Stock are being acquired for investment purposes only and solely for Reporting Person's own account.  Under a December 20, 2024, Cancellation Agreement with CAP, Reporting Person was issued 181,674 shares of Series B-1 Stock shares to cancel a debt of $887,763.00 (constituting money loaned to CAP).

        <numberOfShares>Series B-1 Stock shares have no voting rights - but if converted into Common Stock, then Reporting Person has sole voting power over all shares of Common Stock. If all 189,174 shares are converted, Reporting Person would receive and own 12,610,338.84 shares of Common Stock with each share having one vote per share, and Reporting Person would have sole voting power over 12,610,338.34 shares of Common Stock in addition to the 9,034,20 shares of Common Stock that he owns.

Reporting Person has 300,000 option shares that have vested but not been exercised, which, if all of these option shares were exercised, would increase Reporting Person's ownership of shares of Common Stock to 9,334,120 or approximately 19% of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.

Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference will be to a section of or exhibit to this Agreement

as another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine
gender will include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. The words &ldquo;includes&rdquo; or &ldquo;including&rdquo; will mean &ldquo;including

the word &ldquo;extent&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;to the extent&rdquo; will mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends
and such phrase will not mean simply &ldquo;if,&rdquo; any reference to a &ldquo;law&rdquo; will include any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any reference to &ldquo;any law&rdquo; in this Agreement will mean such law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented. Each reference to a &ldquo;wholly owned subsidiary&rdquo; or &ldquo;wholly owned subsidiaries&rdquo; of a person will be
deemed to include any subsidiary of such person where all of the equity interests of such subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned
by such person (other than directors qualifying shares, nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or regulation
