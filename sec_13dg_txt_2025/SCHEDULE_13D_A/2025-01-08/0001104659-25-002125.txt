        <commentText>EXPLANATORY NOTE:

This Amendment No. 6 (this "Amendment No. 6") to Schedule 13D is being filed by the Reporting Persons to amend the original Schedule 13D, as amended through Amendment No. 5 thereto (the "original Schedule 13D") to reflect the disposition by Eagle Canada Common Holdings LP and BIF IV Eagle NR Carry LP (collectively, the "Purchaser Reporting Persons") of an aggregate 8,600,000 common shares (the "Common Shares") in the capital of TransAlta Corporation (the "Issuer"), as described in Item 4 of this Amendment No. 6.

Information reported and defined terms used in the original Schedule 13D remain in effect, unless they are amended or superseded by information or defined terms contained in this Amendment No. 6. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the original Schedule 13D.</commentText>
      </item1>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 of the original Schedule 13D is hereby supplemented as follows:

The Purchaser Reporting Persons disposed of an aggregate 8,600,000 Common Shares in a block trade pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately C$168,990,000 (excluding brokerage commission), at a price of C$19.65 per Common Share.

The disposition of the Common Shares reported in this Amendment No. 6 more closely aligns the Reporting Persons' aggregate share ownership with certain thresholds under the Investment Agreement. Although the Reporting Persons have no current specific plan or proposal for further dispositions of the Common Shares, the Reporting Persons also may, at any time and from time to time, subject to compliance at all relevant times with the Investment Agreement, A&amp;R Margin Loan Agreement and regulatory requirements and applicable securities laws, terminate in whole or in part, dispose of or distribute some or all of their Common Shares or such other securities they own or may subsequently acquire, depending on various factors, including the price of the Common Shares, terms and conditions applicable to any potential transaction, liquidity and diversification objectives of the Reporting Persons and such other factors that the Reporting Persons deem relevant at any time or from time to time.</transactionPurpose>
