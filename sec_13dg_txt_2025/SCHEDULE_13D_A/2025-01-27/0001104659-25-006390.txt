In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, dated as of March 27, 2024, by and between the Operating Partnership and RMP 3535, entered into in connection with the RMP 3535 Sale, BET Trust may not redeem the OP Units for Shares, unless such redemption is approved by a majority of the votes cast on the matter at a meeting of stockholders of the Issuer or by written consent of the stockholders of the Issuer in lieu of a special meeting to the extent permitted by applicable federal and state law. BET Trust disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares that may be issuable upon exchange of the OP Units.

The information in Item 4 of this Schedule 13D is incorporated herein by reference.

The foregoing descriptions of each of the Subscription Agreement, the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, the First Assignment Agreement, the First Amendment, the Op Unit Assignment Agreement, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and the RMP 3535 Assignment Agreement are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
