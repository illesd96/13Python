        <commentContent>(1) The Aggregate Amount Beneficially Owned by Each Reporting Person in Row (11) with Sole Voting Power in Row (7) and Sole Dispositive Power in Row (9) comprised of (i) 78,163,078 shares of Class A Common Stock of AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (the "Issuer") that may be issued upon redemption by the Reporting Person of 78,163,078 common units (the "AST Common Units") of AST &amp; Science LLC ("AST"). In addition, the Reporting Person beneficially owns 78,163,078 shares of Class C Common Stock of the Issuer (the "Class C Common Stock"). Each share of Class A Common Stock carries one vote per share and each share of Class C Common Stock carries ten votes per share and no economic rights. From and after April 6, 2022, the Reporting Person may redeem or exchange one AST Common Unit for one share of Class A Common Stock or, under certain circumstances and at the election of the Issuer, a cash payment based on the value of Class A Common Stock. At the time of any redemption or exchange, the Reporting Person would forfeit an equivalent number of shares of Class C Common Stock to the Issuer. The Reporting Person did not redeem or exchange AST Common Units as of January 22, 2025.

As discussed in Item 2 of the Original Filing, the other Stockholder Parties (as defined herein) are not included as reporting persons in this Schedule 13D, and the Reporting Persons expressly disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially held by the other Stockholders Parties.

(2) The Percent of Class Represented by Amount in Row (11) are based upon 312,681,161 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding comprised of (i) 234,518,083 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of January 22, 2025, and (ii) 78,163,078 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the redemption or exchange of the AST Common Units owned by the Reporting Person. This percentage does not represent the Reporting Person's current voting interest in the Issuer, as the Reporting Person has a 76.1% voting interest in the Issuer by virtue of his ownership of all of the shares of Class C Common Stock of the Issuer.

AMENDMENT NO. 12 TO SCHEDULE 13D

This Amendment No. 12 to Schedule 13D (this "Amendment No. 12") amends and supplements the initial Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Abel Avellan with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 11, 2022 (the "Original Filing"), as amended by Amendment No. 11 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on November 20, 2024 ("Amendment No. 11"), as amended by Amendment No. 10 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on October 15, 2024 ("Amendment No. 10"), as amended by Amendment No. 9 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on September 26, 2024 ("Amendment No. 9"), as amended by Amendment No. 8 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on August 26, 2024 ("Amendment No. 8"), Amendment No. 7 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on July 11, 2024 ("Amendment No. 7"), Amendment No. 6 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on June 14, 2024 ("Amendment No. 6"), Amendment No. 5 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on March 6, 2024 ("Amendment No. 5"), Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on January 25, 2024 ("Amendment No. 4"), Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on July 6, 2023 ("Amendment No. 3"), Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on May 2, 2023 ("Amendment No. 2") and Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Avellan with the SEC on December 13, 2022 ("Amendment No. 1").

        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5 is amended and restated to read as follows:

On January 22, 2025, the Company notified the holders of its 5.50% convertible PIK toggle notes entered into in 2024 (the "2024 Convertible Notes") that the Company is exercising its option to require all of such notes to convert into shares of Class A common stock. The principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes, plus accrued interest through the date hereof, is approximately $148.5 million, which will be converted into 25,818,541 shares of the Company's Class A common stock. Upon the issuance of the shares, which will occur as promptly as practicable thereafter, subject to receipt of any required governmental approvals, the percentage of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock that the Reporting Person may be deemed to beneficially own was reduced by more than one percent (1%) of the Issuer's shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding since the filing of Amendment No. 11. Mr. Avellan did not sell any Class A Common Stock or any other securities of the Company.

As of the date hereof, the aggregate number and percentage of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Avellan are as follows:

Amount beneficially owned: 78,163,078

Percent of class: 25.0%</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>Sole power to vote or direct the vote: 78,163,078
Shared power to vote: 0
Sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of: 78,163,078
Shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of: 0

The reporting Person may be deemed to beneficially own 78,163,078 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of 78,163,078 AST Common Units held of record by the Reporting Person.

As discussed in Item 2 of the Original Filing, the other Stockholder Parties are not included as reporting persons in the Original Filing, Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 3, Amendment No. 4, Amendment No. 5, Amendment No. 6, Amendment No. 7, Amendment No. 8, Amendment No. 9, Amendment No. 10, Amendment No. 11, and this Amendment No. 12, and the Reporting Person expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Class A Common Stock held by the other Stockholder Parties.</numberOfShares>
