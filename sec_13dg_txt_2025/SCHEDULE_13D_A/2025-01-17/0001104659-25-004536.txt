        <commentContent>(1) As of the date hereof, Michael Mo (the "Reporting Person") may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 24,941,340 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of KULR Technology Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer" or the "Company"), which amount includes: (i) 19,755,110 shares held directly by Mr. Mo, (ii) 1,400,000 shares held jointly by Mr. Mo and his spouse, Linda Mo, and (iii) an aggregate of 3,786,230 shares underlying various restricted stock unit grants, even though they are not expected to settle or vest within 60 days of this filing, but excludes, shares held by Mr. Mo's son Alexander Mo and shares held by Mr. Mo's son Brandon Mo, over which shares Mr. Mo disclaims beneficial ownership, as Mr. Mo has no control over the dispositive or voting power over the shares and his sons no longer live in the same household as Mr. Mo.

(2) As of the date hereof, the Reporting Person beneficially owns an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Non-Convertible Series A Voting Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). Each share of the Preferred Stock entitles the Reporting Person to votes equal to one hundred (100) votes per share of Preferred Stock held.

(3) The foregoing reported beneficial ownership percentage is based on 273,554,067 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and assumes the issuance of 3,786,230 shares underlying various restricted stock units granted to Mr. Mo, even though they are not expected to settle or vest within 60 days of this filing.

(4) Mr. Mo is the sole holder of all issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and after giving effect to the voting rights of such Preferred Stock and the voting rights of the Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Mo, the aggregate voting power held by Mr. Mo would be 33.11% of all voting rights of the Issuer's voting securities (based on 377,340,297 aggregate votes).</commentContent>
