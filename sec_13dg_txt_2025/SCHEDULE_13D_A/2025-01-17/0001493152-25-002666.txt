        <transactionPurpose>The Reporting Persons acquired the Common Stock owned by them for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons believed the securities of the Issuer represented an attractive investment opportunity and have invested in the securities based on their review of the business of the Issuer and belief in the long term value of the Issuer and its securities.

As a non-employee director of the Issuer, Mr. Wang may be entitled to certain equity compensation arrangements generally applicable to the Issuer's non-employee directors as disclosed in the Issuer's Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC.
