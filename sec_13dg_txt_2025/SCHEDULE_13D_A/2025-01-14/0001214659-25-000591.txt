<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">This COOPERATION AGREEMENT (this &ldquo;<U>Agreement</U>&rdquo;)
is made and entered into as of January 10, 2025, by and between GrafTech International Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the &ldquo;<U>Company</U>&rdquo;),
and Nilesh Undavia (the &ldquo;<U>Stockholder</U>&rdquo;). The Company and the Stockholder are each herein referred to as a &ldquo;<U>Party</U>&rdquo;
and together, the &ldquo;<U>Parties</U>.&rdquo; Following the Company&rsquo;s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the &ldquo;<U>2024
Annual Meeting</U>&rdquo;) the Parties have continued discussions regarding, among other things, the composition of the Board of Directors
of the Company (the &ldquo;<U>Board</U>&rdquo;), and the Parties have determined to come to an agreement with respect thereto and certain
other matters, as provided in this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to
be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">(a) <I>Appointment and Nomination
of New Directors</I>. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Board and all necessary and applicable committees
of the Board shall take all necessary actions to appoint Sachin Shivaram (the &ldquo;<U>New Class III Director</U>&rdquo;) to the Board
as a Class III director with a term expiring at the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company (including any adjournments, postponements,
reschedulings or continuations thereof and any meeting which may be called in lieu thereof, the &ldquo;<U>2027 Annual Meeting</U>&rdquo;),
and (ii) the Parties will work in good faith to find a mutually agreeable independent candidate (the &ldquo;<U>New Class I Director</U>&rdquo;
and together with the New Class III Director, the &ldquo;<U>New Directors</U>&rdquo;) to nominate for election to the Board by stockholders
at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company (including any adjournments, postponements, reschedulings or continuations thereof
and any meeting which may be called in lieu thereof, the &ldquo;<U>2025 Annual Meeting</U>&rdquo;) as a Class I director with a term expiring
at the 2028 annual meeting of stockholders (including any adjournments, postponements, reschedulings or continuations thereof and any
meeting which may be called in lieu thereof, the &ldquo;<U>2028 Annual Meeting</U>&rdquo;), with each of the New Class III Director, and
the New Class I Director if elected at the 2025 Annual Meeting, so serving his or her respective full class term as a director or until
the earlier death, disability, resignation, disqualification or removal of each.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">(b) <I>Committees</I>. The
Board and all necessary and applicable committees of the Board shall give each of the New Directors the same due consideration for committee
membership as any other independent director, including, but not limited to, membership on any newly formed Board committee or any other
Board committee formed after the date hereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that so long as each New Director meets all regulatory
requirements and other currently existing and publicly disclosed qualifications for such committees, each of the New Directors shall be
appointed to at least two committees of the Board.</P>

</FONT>If the Parties find a mutually agreeable independent candidate for nomination as the New Class I Director in time for inclusion
on the ballot of the 2025 Annual Meeting, the Company agrees that the Board and all necessary and applicable committees of the Board shall
take all necessary actions to nominate the New Class I Director as a Class I director for election to the Board at the 2025 Annual Meeting
with a term expiring at the 2028 Annual Meeting, to include the New Class I Director in the proxy statement and the proxy card prepared,
filed and delivered in connection with the 2025 Annual Meeting and to recommend, support and solicit proxies for the election of the New
Class I Director at the 2025 Annual Meeting in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the Company supports,
and has historically supported, Board nominees for election at any annual or special meetings of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders or actions
by written consent of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders (each, a &ldquo;<U>Stockholder Meeting</U>&rdquo;), unless the Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, that it can
no longer recommend the New Class I Director due to facts that occur or circumstances that arise after the date of this Agreement (a &ldquo;<U>Recommendation
Change</U>&rdquo;).</P>

the Stockholder&rsquo;s receipt of such Fiduciary Duty Determination Notice, the Parties will work in good faith to find a mutually agreeable
candidate to replace the New Class I Director as a nominee for election to the Board at the 2025 Annual Meeting with a term expiring at
the 2028 Annual Meeting (any such person, if and when such person is elected to the Board, shall be referred to as the New Class I Director
