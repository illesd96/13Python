Binding Term Sheet

On January 13, 2025 (the "Term Sheet Date"), BAMCO and Baron Capital Management, Inc. ("BCM" and together with BAMCO, "Baron") entered into a Binding Term Sheet (the "Term Sheet") with the Issuer, pursuant to which the Issuer and Baron (i) entered into certain agreements and (ii) memorialized certain terms to be set forth in a stockholders agreement (the "SHA"), in each case, as further summarized below.  The parties have agreed to execute the SHA as promptly as practicable following the Term Sheet Date.

Standstill Restrictions

From and after January 13, 2025 until the date that Baron and its affiliates (collectively, the "Stockholder Group") cease to hold at least 17.5% of the outstanding shares of the Issuer's Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ("Class A Common Stock"), Baron has agreed that it will not, and it will cause its affiliates not to, purchase any equity securities of the Issuer without the Issuer's prior written consent.  This restriction does not apply to the shares of Class A Common Stock that Baron has acquired, and may acquire, under the Agreement (the "Put-Call Shares").

Additionally, from January 13, 2025 until the earlier to occur of (i) the time and date of the Final Conversion Event (as defined in Section 7.4 of Article IV.A. of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Issuer dated June 1, 2021), (ii) the date that Catherine Spear ceases to be the Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer and (iii) the date that the Stockholder Group ceases to hold at least 17.5% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (such period, the "Standstill Period"), the Stockholder Group must abide by certain other standstill restrictions, including restrictions on participating in a proxy contest and engaging in or facilitating extraordinary transactions with the Issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions).

Transfer Restrictions

During the Standstill Period, the Stockholder Group has agreed that it will not transfer any of the Put-Call Shares, except (i) with the Issuer's prior written consent, (ii) to a wholly owned subsidiary of Baron or other entity controlled or managed by BAMCO or a subsidiary thereof or (iii) in connection with a redemption of interests by an investor in an entity holding Put-Call Shares.

Voting Cutback

The Stockholder Group shall be entitled to vote the Put-Call Shares, in its sole and absolute discretion, except that during the Standstill Period, any Put-Call Shares that it owns in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the Issuer's then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock must be voted in favor of all persons nominated to serve as directors of the Issuer by the board of directors of the Issuer.

Registration Rights

The SHA will provide the Stockholder Group with customary demand, piggyback and shelf registration rights.</contractDescription>
