<contractDescription>Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended to add the following language:

On January 10, 2025, the Issuer entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Enfusion Ltd. LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of the Issuer (the "Operating Company"), Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Clearwater"), Poseidon Acquirer, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Clearwater ("Acquirer"), Poseidon Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Clearwater ("Merger Sub"), and Poseidon Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of Clearwater ("Merger Sub II").

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Support Agreements

In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, on January 10, 2025, Clearwater entered into Support Agreements with Fund IV and Holdings, each a stockholder of the Company (collectively, the "Significant Stockholders", and such agreements, the "Support Agreements"). The Support Agreements generally require that the Significant Stockholders vote their Subject Shares (as defined in each Support Agreement), which represent, in the aggregate approximately 25.23% of the total voting power of the Company, in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and against any competing acquisition proposals, and take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in each Support Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Support Agreements prohibit transfers by the Significant Stockholders of any of their Subject Shares prior to the termination of the Support Agreements and other actions that would impair their ability to fulfill their obligations under the Support Agreements.

The foregoing summary of the Support Agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of each of the Support Agreements, respectively, filed as Exhibits 4 and 5 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Tax Receivable Agreement

Under the existing Tax Receivables Agreement, dated October 19, 2021, among Fund IV, CSL Tech Holdings, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, ISP V-B EF LP, a Delaware limited partnership, ISP V Main Fund EF LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, the "TRA Amendment Parties"), and each of the other persons from time to time party thereto (together with the TRA Amendment Parties, the "TRA Holders" and such agreement, the "TRA"), the Company and the Operating Company, the TRA Holders are entitled to receive 85% of the benefits, if any, that the Company actually realizes, or is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions), as a result of certain transactions, including the Mergers. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, on January 10, 2025, the Company, the Operating Company and the TRA Amendment Parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Tax Receivable Agreement (the "TRA Amendment"), pursuant to which, among other things, at the Effective Time, the TRA will automatically terminate and the Company will pay an aggregate of $30 million to the TRA Payment Recipients (as defined in the TRA). In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the consummation of the Mergers, the TRA Amendment will be void and have no further force and effect.

The foregoing description of the TRA Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the TRA Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 6 and is incorporated by reference herein.</contractDescription>

This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the applicable statute of limitations, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules that would cause the application of law of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. The Parties agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the state or federal courts in the State of Delaware (the &#x201c;<font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Delaware Courts</font>&#x201d;). Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts.&nbsp; Each Party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by <u>Section 5.1</u> or in any other manner permitted by law.
