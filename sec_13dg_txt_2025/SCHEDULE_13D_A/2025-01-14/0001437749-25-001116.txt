Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended to add each of the following paragraphs below:

On January 9, 2025, Synergy and USEG entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the PSA).  Pursuant to the PSA, Synergy agreed to sell to USEG certain assets covering certain properties in the State of Montana (the Assets), which consist of approximately 24,000 net operated acres located in the Kevin Dome structure. The purchase price for the Assets consists of: (i) $2.0 million of cash, subject to customary adjustments; (ii) 1,400,000 shares of USEG Common Stock; (iii) a (Carried Working Interest) consisting of USEG's commitment to cover and pay for 100% of Seller Costs (as defined below) attributable to the Seller Reserved Interest (as defined below) in the Assets during the Carry Period (as defined below); (iv) an agreement by USEG to pay Synergy 18% of cash amounts actually realized by, received by, or credited to USEG, directly or indirectly, at or following the closing (less any necessary incurred expenses), generated or resulting from or credited to USEG, directly or indirectly, pursuant to Section 45Q of 26 U.S.C. or any similar law or regulation allowing for benefits resulting from USEG's sequestration of carbon oxides or similar substances derived directly from the AMI (as defined below)(the Tax Credit Payments); and (v) an agreement by USEG to pay Synergy 18% of any gain received by USEG on any sale of an initial CO2 plant, including any expansions connected to the initial installation that processes production from withing the AMI in which USEG has a financial interest.  The (Seller Reserved Interest) includes an undivided 20.0% of Synegy's rights, title and interest in the leases and lands and other assets and other excluded assets.  The (Carry Period) is the closing date of the PSA through the date that is the earlier of (i) 78 months after the closing date, or (ii) the date the Seller Costs attributable to the Seller Reserved Interest total a maximum amount of $20.0 million (the Carry Amount). (Seller Costs) are the costs relating to drilling, completing, in-field gathering and storage, and equipping of any and all wells to the extent that such costs are chargeable to or payable by Synergy as further described under a Joint Operating Agreement naming USEG as the Operator (the JOA).  Concurrently with the execution of the PSA, Synergy and USEG also entered into a Participation Agreement (the Participation Agreement), which establishes certain rights and obligations with respect to the Assets and an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) surrounding the Assets.

The foregoing summaries of the PSA and Participation Agreement are qualified by the terms of the PSA, including the form of Participation Agreement attached as an exhibit thereto, which are filed as Exhibit 8 to this Schedule 13D, and are incorporated by reference herein.</fundsSource>
      </item3>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>The information set forth in Item 3 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 4.

The Reporting Persons acquired the securities for investment purposes. In the future, depending on general market and economic conditions affecting the Issuer and other relevant factors, the Reporting Persons may purchase additional securities of the Issuer or dispose of some or all of the securities they currently own from time to time in open market transactions, private transactions (including gifts) or otherwise.

Except as may occur in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer and as discussed herein, the Reporting Persons do not currently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in the following described:

(a) The acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer, or the disposition of securities of the Issuer;

(b) An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;

(c) A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;

(d) Any change in the present board of directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board;

(e) Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer;

(f) Any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure, including but not limited to, if the Issuer is a registered closed-end investment company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment policy for which a vote is required by section 13 of the Investment Company Act of 1940;

(g) Changes in the Issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person;

(h) Causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;

(i) A class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or

(j) Any action similar to any of those enumerated above (except as discussed below).

The Reporting Persons retain the right to change their investment intent, and may, from time to time, acquire additional shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer, or sell or otherwise dispose of (or enter into a plan or arrangements to sell or otherwise dispose of), all or part of the shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer, if any, beneficially owned by them, in any manner permitted by law.

Additionally, Mr. Weinzierl, in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of the Issuer, may from time to time, become aware of, initiate, and/or be involved in discussions that relate to the transactions described in this Item 4 and thus retains his right to modify his plans with respect to the transactions described in this Item 4 and to formulate plans and proposals that could result in the occurrence of any such events, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Mr. Weinzierl also engages in discussions with management, directors and other stockholders of the Issuer that have in the past included, and in the future are expected to include, transactions with affiliates of the Reporting Person or their respective affiliates, which own or control interests in other assets that may be deemed of interest to the Issuer. These discussions include informal, exploratory discussions as well as asset evaluations and discussions regarding potential structuring matters associated with potential transactions as part of determining their feasibility for any proposal or plan by the Issuer or such Reporting Persons. Any such transactions would depend on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position and strategic direction, price levels of the Common Stock, conditions in the securities market and general economic and industry conditions, as well as alternative opportunities available to the Reporting Persons with respect to assets owned or controlled by the Reporting Persons or their affiliates.

Following the distribution of shares of Common Stock by Lubbock Energy Partners LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Lubbock), on July 19, 2022, Lubbock no longer owns any shares of Common Stock; however, Lubbock continues to have certain rights under the Nominating and Voting Agreement by virtue of its affiliates continuing to own more than 5% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock (including Mr. Weinzierl and others as affiliates), and Mr. Weinzierl may cause Lubbock to exercise combined voting power with respect to the nomination of directors pursuant to the Nominating and Voting Agreement.

As discussed above in Item 3, on January 9, 2025, Synergy and USEG entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Pursuant to the PSA, Synergy agreed to sell to USEG certain assets covering certain properties in the State of Montana, which consist of approximately 24,000 net operated acres located in the Kevin Dome structure.  The purchase price for the Assets consists of: (i) $2.0 million of cash, subject to customary adjustments; (ii) 1,400,000 shares of USEG Common Stock; (iii) a (Carried Working Interest) consisting of USEG's commitment to cover and pay for 100% of Seller Costs attributable to the Seller Reserved Interest in the Assets during the Carry Period; (iv) an agreement by USEG to pay Synergy 18% of cash amounts actually realized by, received by, or credited to USEG, directly or indirectly, at or following the closing (less any necessary incurred expenses), generated or resulting from or credited to USEG, directly or indirectly, pursuant to Section 45Q of 26 U.S.C. or any similar law or regulation allowing for benefits resulting from USEG's sequestration of carbon oxides or similar substances derived directly from the AMI; and (v) an agreement by USEG to pay Synergy 18% of any gain received by USEG on any sale of an initial CO2 plant, including any expansions connected to the initial installation that processes production from withing the AMI in which USEG has a financial interest. Concurrently with the execution of the PSA, Synergy and USEG also entered into a Participation Agreement (the Participation Agreement), which establishes certain rights and obligations with respect to the Assets and an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) surrounding the Assets.
