        <commentContent>Sole Voting Power includes 100,000 shares of Issuer's common stock underlying Warrants and 700,000 shares of the Issuer's Class A common stock (both of which are described further below). As provided in the Issuer's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each share of Class A common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of the Issuer's common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Class A common stock, the Reporting Person is entitled to cast, for each share of Class A common stock held by the Reporting Person, the number of votes that is equal to one and one-tenth (1.1) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the shares of outstanding common stock and the denominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A common stock. Accordingly, as long as the Reporting Person owns any shares of Class A common stock (and as long as no other person or entity owns any shares of Class A common stock), it will be able to control or significantly influence all matters requiring approval by the Issuer's stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. An aggregate 100,000 shares of Issuer common stock underlie Common Stock Warrants dated July 15, 2015, as amended by the Amended and Restated Common Stock Warrant dated December 12, 2016, issued by the Reporting Person to Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., the Reporting Person's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael S. Weiss, the Reporting Person's Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, pursuant to the Fortress Biotech, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 'Warrants'). The Warrants, which have an exercise price of $1.29 per share, are exercisable until July 15, 2035. The Reporting Person must reserve from its holdings of the Issuer's common stock the shares underlying the Warrants until the Warrants are exercised. The foregoing description of the Warrants is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Amended and Restated Common Stock Warrant which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 7.03. Mr. Weiss currently serves as the Chairman of the Issuer's Board of Directors and also served as its Interim CEO and President from August 2015 until October 2015 and Executive Chairman from March 2015 until December 2016. Dr. Rosenwald currently serves as a member of the Issuer's Board of Directors and, from November 2014 to August 2015, was the Issuer's Interim Chief Executive Officer and President.

Sole Dispositive Power includes 700,000 shares of the Issuer's Class A common stock and excludes the 100,000 shares of Issuer's common stock underlying the Warrants.

Shared Dispositive Power consists solely of the 100,000 shares of Issuer's common stock underlying the Warrants.

All percentage calculations set forth herein are based upon 48,132,500 shares of the Issuer's common stock and 700,000 shares of Class A common stock as reported by the issuer on its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 12, 2024, 81,407 shares of Issuer's common stock issued as an Offering Equity Grant, and 2,386,808 shares of Issuer's common stock issued as the 2024 Annual Equity Grant (defined below).

This Amendment No. 9 to Schedule 13D (this 'Amendment No. 9') amends and supplements the Schedule 13D filed on May 26, 2017 (as amended and supplemented through the date of this Amendment No. 9, collectively, the 'Schedule 13D') relating to the Common Stock of Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (the 'Issuer'), by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (the 'Reporting Person'). Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment No. 9 does not modify any of the information previously reported on the Schedule 13D. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings as are ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D, as applicable.</commentContent>
