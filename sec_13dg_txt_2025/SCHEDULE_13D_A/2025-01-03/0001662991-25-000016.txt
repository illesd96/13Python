On July 27, 2019, the Issuer granted Mr. Paradis an option to purchase 13,159 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $31.92 under the Issuer's 2019 Incentive Plan pursuant to an Option Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit 10.1, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such option is fully-vested and expires on July 26, 2029 (the "Option Agreement").

On June 14, 2023, the Issuer granted Mr. Paradis 31,579 restricted stock units under the Issuer's 2021 Incentive Plan pursuant to an Equity Incentive Plan Notice Award in the form attached as Exhibit 10.2, which is hereby incorporated by reference (the "RSU Grant 1").

On November 20, 2023, Mr. Paradis adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (the "Paradis Plan") that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). The Paradis Plan provides for the potential sale of up to 131,580 shares of the Company's common stock, from February 23, 2024 until termination of the Paradis Plan on November 27, 2024, or earlier if all transactions under the Paradis Plan are completed.

On September 16, 2024, Mr. Paradis' spouse entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (the "Spousal Plan") that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). The Spousal Plan provides for the potential sale of up to 55,500 shares of the Company's common stock, between an estimated start date of January 2, 2025, until termination of the Paradis Plan on September 12, 2025, or earlier if all transactions under the Spousal Plan are completed. The Spousal Plan was amended on December 2, 2024 (the "Amended Spousal Plan") to reduce the number of shares of Company's common stock subject to the Spousal Plan to 12,000 shares of Company common stock, with an estimated start date of April 1, 2025, until termination of the Amended Spousal Plan on September 12, 2025.

The grant is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants, other awards or benefits in lieu of grants, even if grants have been granted repeatedly in the past, and all decisions with respect to future grants or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. In addition, Grantee&#8217;s participation in the Plan is voluntary, and the grant and the Shares subject to the grant are extraordinary items that do not constitute regular compensation for services rendered to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and are outside the scope of Grantee&#8217;s employment contract, if any. The grant and the RUSs and Shares subject to the grant are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not part of normal or expected salary or compensation for any purpose, including but not limited to calculating severance payments, if any, upon termination.</font></div><div style="height:72pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">- 5 -</font></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:72pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:right"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Exhibit 10.2</font></div></div><div style="text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">9.</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:27pt;text-decoration:underline">Data Privacy</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">. </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Grantee&#8217;s personal data (as described below) by and among, as applicable, the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering, and managing Grantee&#8217;s participation in the Plan.
