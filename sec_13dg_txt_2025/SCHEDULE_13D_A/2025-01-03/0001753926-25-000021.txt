        <contractDescription>The Reporting Person and Spartan are parties to the Proxy, pursuant to which, among other things, Spartan agreed to grant to the Reporting Person all voting power over (i) an aggregate of 303,041 shares of Series C Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Issuer ("Preferred Stock"), of which (a) 260,108 shares were issued to Spartan and its designee in connection with an initial closing of a private placement of securities of the Issuer (the "Offering") on December 23, 2024, and (b) 42,933 shares were issued to Spartan and its designee in connection with a subsequent closing of the Offering on December 31, 2024 (the "Subsequent Closing"), which shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 303,041 shares of Common Stock (the "Conversion Shares") at any time after the date on which the registration statement filed by the Issuer registering the reoffer and resale of such shares of Preferred Stock is declared effective by the SEC; (ii) an aggregate of up to 97,216 shares of Common Stock issuable to Spartan (the "Warrant Shares") upon exercise of Common Stock purchase warrants issued to Spartan in the Offering (each, a Warrant and collectively, the "Warrants), consisting of (a) up to 85,421 Warrant Shares issued in connection with the initial closing of the Offering and (b) up to 11,795 Warrant Shares in connection with the Subsequent Closing; and (iii) any Conversion Shares that may be issued to Spartan. The conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise of the Warrants are each subject to beneficial ownership limitation provisions in the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designation") and the Warrants, respectively, which prohibit the holder thereof from converting such shares of Preferred Stock or exercising the Warrants for shares of Common Stock, if, as a result of such conversion or exercise, respectively, such holder, together with its affiliates and any persons acting as a group together with such holder or any such affiliates, would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the total number of shares Common Stock then issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as applicable.

Due to the applicable restrictions on the conversion of the Preferred Stock and the exercise of the Warrants in the Certificate of Designation and Warrants, respectively, the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares are not deemed beneficially owned by the Reporting Person because they cannot be acquired within sixty days of the date of the filing of this Amendment No. 8.

Except as described in this Item 6 above regarding the additional securities issued to Spartan in connection with the Subsequent Closing, the information contained in "Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer." of the Schedule 13D is not being amended by this Amendment No. 8.</contractDescription>

or management of the Corporation at the time of such proposed disposition, (iii) if such disposition will, to Spartan&rsquo;s knowledge,
result in such third party (together with all of such third party&rsquo;s &ldquo;affiliates&rdquo; (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended) and any other persons acting as a group together with such third party) being deemed a &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo;
(as defined under Rule 13d-3) of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after giving effect to such disposition.
In addition, this Irrevocable Proxy shall terminate with respect to Consultant Shares, Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares (as applicable)
upon each disposition of Consultant Shares, Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares (as applicable) by an Attribution Party to a non-Attribution
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Transfer of Consultant Shares, Conversion Shares or Warrant Shares by Spartan (or any other Attribution
Party) to an Attribution Party shall only become effective upon such transferee&rsquo;s delivery of a completed and executed Joinder
Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as <U>Schedule II</U>. The Company undertakes to include the maximum possible number
of Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares in the initial registration statement filed in connection with the Offering and in each subsequent
registration statement, as needed, and agrees to lift all Transfer and notice restrictions six months after any issuance if such Conversion
Shares and Warrant Shares are not then registered for resale.</FONT></P>
