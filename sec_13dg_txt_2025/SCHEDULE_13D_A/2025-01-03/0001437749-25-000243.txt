        <commentText>This Schedule 13D/A constitutes Amendment No. 7 (this "Schedule 13D/A No. 7") to the original Schedule 13D dated June 17, 2014, as amended on October 28, 2014, February 16, 2016, May 21, 2019, May 4, 2020, May 3, 2023, and April 3, 2024 (as amended, the "Original Schedule 13D"), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Mr. Raymond C. Stachowiak, a member and the Executive Chairman of the board of directors (the "Board") and Chief Executive Officer of American Shared Hospital Services, a California corporation (the "Issuer"). The Original Schedule 13D reported Mr. Stachowiak's ownership of the Issuer's common stock, no par value (the "Common Stock"), both directly and indirectly through RCS Investments, Inc., an Illinois corporation ("RCS"), of which Mr. Stachowiak is the owner-president, and Stachowiak Equity Fund, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company ("Stachowiak Equity"; together with RCS and Mr. Stachowiak, the "Reporting Persons," and each, a "Reporting Person"), of which Mr. Stachowiak is the owner-manager.

This Schedule 13D/A No. 7 is being filed to report the shares of Common Stock (the "Common Shares") that Mr. Stachowiak has acquired since filing Amendment No. 6 to the Original Schedule 13D with the SEC on April 3, 2024 (the "Schedule 13D/A No. 6"). This Schedule 13D/A No. 7 also updates the percentage of beneficial ownership reported for Stachowiak Equity, which immaterially decreased due to an increase in the Issuer's total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares since the Schedule 13D/A No. 6 was filed. Only those items that are hereby reported are amended; all other items reported in the Original Schedule 13D remain unchanged. Information given in response to each item shall be deemed incorporated by reference in all other items, as applicable. Capitalized terms not defined in this Schedule 13D/A No. 7 have the meanings ascribed to them in the Original Schedule 13D.

        <fundsSource>This Schedule 13D/A No. 7 supplements Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D by adding the following:

Source of Mr. Stachowiak's Shares.  The aggregate number of Common Shares reported as beneficially owned (the "Total Beneficial Ownership Amount") by Mr. Stachowiak in this Schedule 13 D/A No. 7 include the Common Shares acquired in the transactions described below that occurred since Mr. Stachowiak's reporting of beneficial ownership in the Schedule 13D/A No. 6.

On March 22, 2024, Mr. Stachowiak was granted an award of 120,000 RSUs (the "2024 RSUs"), which vested in equal quarterly installments on April 1, 2024, July 1, 2024, October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025. The Total Beneficial Ownership Amount reported for Mr. Stachowiak in this Schedule 13D/A No. 7 includes the 90,000 Common Shares underlying 90,000 of the 2024 RSUs that vested on July 1, 2024, October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, which were excluded from Mr. Stachowiak's Total Beneficial Ownership Amount in the Schedule 13D/A No. 6 because the RSUs did not vest within 60 days of the filing date of the Schedule 13D/A No. 6.</fundsSource>

        <transactionPurpose>This Schedule 13D/A No. 7 amends and restates Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D as follows:

The information reported in Item 3 of this Schedule 13D/A No. 7 is incorporated by reference into this Item 4. The Common Shares reported as beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons will be held for investment purposes.

Before Mr. Stachowiak became an officer and director of the Issuer, the securities acquired by Mr. Stachowiak were primarily acquired through purchases using his personal funds. After Mr. Stachowiak became an officer of the Issuer, Mr. Stachowiak acquired Common Shares from the Issuer as partial compensation for his service as a director and officer.

Mr. Stachowiak is a director and the Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer, the owner-president of RCS, and the owner-manager of Stachowiak Equity. Except as set forth herein and to the extent that Mr. Stachowiak may have influence over the corporate activities of the Issuer, including activities that may relate to the items described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons do not have any present plan or proposal that relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The Reporting Persons reserve the right to increase or decrease their position in the Issuer through, among other things, the purchase or sale of securities of the Issuer on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise on such terms and at such times as the Reporting Persons may deem advisable. The Reporting Persons reserve the right to change their intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in this Item 4.
