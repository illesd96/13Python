This Amendment No. 8 to the statement on Schedule 13D ("Amendment No. 8") amends the Schedule 13D originally filed by the Reporting Persons (as defined herein) on January 25, 2024, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 filed on May 23, 2024, Amendment No. 2 filed on August 6, 2024, Amendment No. 3 filed on August 16, 2024, Amendment No. 4 filed on September 4, 2024, Amendment No. 5 filed October 24, 2024, Amendment No. 6 filed November 7, 2024, and Amendment No. 7 filed November 29, 2024 (collectively, the "Schedule 13D"), and relates to the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 ("Common Stock") of the Agrify Corporation ("Issuer") beneficially owned by I-Tseng Jenny Chan (a "Former Reporting Person") with respect to shares of Common Stock that they may be deemed to have beneficial ownership.

In accordance with Rule 13d-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment No. 8 does not modify any of the information previously reported on the Schedule 13D.

        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5(a) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

Former Reporting Person is the record owner of the securities set forth on their respective cover sheet. The percentage of outstanding Common Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by each Former Reporting Person is set forth on Line 13 of each Former Reporting Person's cover sheet. Such percentage was calculated based on the 1,952,032 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <transactionDesc>Item 5(c) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

On December 31, 2024, CP Acquisitions, LLC ("CP"), an entity affiliated with the Former Reporting Person, signed an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Asset Purchase Agreement") for the purchase of the cultivation business of Issuer and simultaneously closed such transaction. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, CP agreed to acquire all assets related to the cultivation portions of the Issuer business from the Company, including but not limited to, the Issuer's Vertical Farming Units, the related Agrify total-turnkey solution assets and Agrify InsightsTM software solutions. In exchange for the cultivation business, CP, among other consideration, terminated the Settled Debt (as defined therein) with respect to the Issuer. The foregoing summary of the Asset Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete.

The percentages used in this Schedule 13D are calculated based on 1,952,032 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of January 3, 2024.</transactionDesc>
        <date5PercentOwnership>Item 5(e) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

As of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Former Reporting Person is no longer a "Reporting Person" because the reporting person has ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class of securities.</date5PercentOwnership>
