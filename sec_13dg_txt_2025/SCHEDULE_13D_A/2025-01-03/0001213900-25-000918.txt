        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5(a) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

Each Former Reporting Person is the record owner of the securities set forth on their respective cover sheet. The percentage of outstanding Common Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by each Former Reporting Person is set forth on Line 13 of each Former Reporting Person's cover sheet. Such percentage was calculated based on the 1,952,032 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Chang hereby disclaims beneficial ownership with respect to the securities held by NXT3J or Raymond Chang Jr., except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <transactionDesc>Item 5(c) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

On December 31, 2024, CP Acquisitions, LLC ("CP"), an entity affiliated with Raymond N. Chang, signed an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Asset Purchase Agreement") for the purchase of the cultivation business of Issuer and simultaneously closed such transaction. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, CP agreed to acquire all assets related to the cultivation portions of the Issuer business from the Company, including but not limited to, the Issuer's Vertical Farming Units, the related Agrify total-turnkey solution assets and Agrify InsightsTM software solutions. In exchange for the cultivation business, CP, among other consideration, terminated the Settled Debt (as defined therein) with respect to the Issuer. The foregoing summary of the Asset Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete.

The percentages used in this Schedule 13D are calculated based on 1,952,032 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of January 3, 2024.</transactionDesc>
        <date5PercentOwnership>Item 5(e) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

 As of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement, each of the Former Reporting Persons is no longer a "Reporting Person" because each of the reporting persons has ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class of securities.</date5PercentOwnership>
