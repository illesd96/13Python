        <fundsSource>Approximately $500,000 of funds held by the Jenkins Family Charitable Institute (the "Institute") were used to purchase 265,000 common stock units and 235,000 pre-funded units of the Company in an underwritten public offering (the "Public Offering") pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated August 30, 2024.  Each common stock unit, priced at a public offering price of $1.00 per unit, consisted of one share of common stock, one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share that expires on the six month anniversary of the date of issuance (a "Series H Warrant"), one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share that expires on the eighteen month anniversary of the date of issuance (a "Series I Warrant"), and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share that expires on the five year anniversary of the date of issuance (a "Series J Warrant").  Each pre-funded unit, priced at a public offering price of $0.9999 per unit, consisted of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share that has no expiration date (a "Pre-Funded Warrant" and together with the Series H Warrants, Series I Warrants and Series J Warrants, the "Warrants"), one Series H Warrant, one Series I Warrant and one Series J Warrant.  The Public Offering closed on September 3, 2024.  Each of the Warrants contained a beneficial ownership blocker that currently prevents the Institute from exercising it to acquire additional shares of common stock if its beneficial ownership of Company common stock would exceed 9.99% immediately after the exercise.  On October 29, 2024, the Company waived the beneficial ownership blocker contained in the Pre-Funded Warrants, and on October 29, 2024, the Institute exercised all of its Pre-Funded Warrants to acquire 235,000 shares of Company common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $23.50. On December 31, 2024, the Institute transferred an aggregate of 450,000 Series J Warrants to its trustee and certain donor advisors as compensation for prior services.  As trustee of the Institute, Casey A. Jenkins received 150,000 of the Series J Warrants transferred.</fundsSource>
