        <commentText>EXPLANATORY NOTE
This Amendment No. 10 to Schedule 13D (this "Amendment") amends the items included herein that were contained in the Schedule 13D filed on December 20, 2023, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed October 8, 2024, Amendment No. 2 filed November 12, 2024, Amendment No. 3 filed November 22, 2024, Amendment No. 4 filed November 27, 2024, Amendment No. 5 filed December 5, 2024, Amendment No. 6 filed December 13, 2024, Amendment No. 7 filed December 20, 2024, Amendment No. 8 filed January 10, 2025, and Amendmen No. 9 filed January 23, 2025 (the "Original Schedule 13D", and together with this Amendment, this "Schedule 13D") relating to shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per shares, and shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per shares, of P10, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"), filed by: (i) 210/P10 Acquisition Partners, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("210/P10"); (ii) 210 Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("210 Capital"); (iii) Covenant RHA Partners, L.P., a Texas limited partnership ("RHA Partners"); (iv) CCW/LAW Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("CCW Holdings"); (v) RHA Investments, Inc., a Texas corporation ("RHA Investments"); (vi) Robert Alpert; and (vii) C. Clark Webb (each, a "Reporting Person" and collectively, the "Reporting Persons").

On January 24, 2025, the Reporting Persons effected transactions that, in the aggregate, resulted in each of the Reporting Persons beneficially owning less than five percent of the outstanding shares Class A common stock of the Issuer. Therefore, this Amendment represents the final amendment to the Schedule 13D and constitutes an exit filing for the Reporting Persons.

Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment does not modify any of the information previously reported in the Original Schedule 13D. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Original Schedule 13D.</commentText>
      </item1>
      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The information contained in rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 on the cover pages of this Schedule 13D (including the footnotes thereto) is incorporated by reference herein.

210/P10 is the direct beneficial holder of 2,996,537 shares of Class A common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by each Reporting Person. 210/P10 is managed by its sole member, 210 Capital, which is managed by its members RHA Partners and CCW Holdings. Mr. Webb has the power to direct the affairs of CCW Holdings as its sole manager. In addition, RHA Partners is managed by its general partner RHA Investments, and Mr. Alpert has the power to direct the affairs of RHA Investments as its President and sole shareholder. Accordingly, each of 210 Capital, RHA Partners, CCW Holdings, RHA Investments, Mr. Alpert and Mr. Webb may be deemed to beneficially own such shares of common stock held by 210/P10. In addition, (i) Mr. Alpert may be deemed to beneficially own 425,093 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of exercisable stock options; and (ii) Mr. Webb may be deemed to beneficially own 425,093 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of exercisable stock options.

However, each Reporting Person declares that neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor anything herein shall be construed as an admission that such person is, for the purposes of Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the beneficial owner of any securities or rights to acquire securities directly held by any other Reporting Person covered by this Schedule 13D.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>The information contained in subsection (a) of this Item 5 is incorporated by reference herein.</numberOfShares>
        <transactionDesc>Except as described herein and on Appendix A attached as Exhibit 9 to this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting Persons have effected any transactions with respect to shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock of the Issuer during the past 60 days or since the filing of the Original Schedule 13D, whichever is less.</transactionDesc>
        <listOfShareholders>No person other than the Reporting Persons is known to have the right to receive, or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of the Class A common stock of the Issuer held by the Reporting Persons.</listOfShareholders>
        <date5PercentOwnership>On January 24, 2025, the Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of more than five percent of the outstanding Class A common stock of the Issuer. Accordingly, this Amendment represents the final amendment to the Schedule 13D and constitutes an exit filing for the Reporting Persons.</date5PercentOwnership>
