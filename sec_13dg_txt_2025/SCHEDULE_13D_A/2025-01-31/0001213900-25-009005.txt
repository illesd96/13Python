        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following:

On December 12, 2024 (the "Effective Date"), P3 Health Group, LLC ("P3 LLC"), a subsidiary of P3 Health Partners Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a financing transaction with VBC Growth SPV 3, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("VBC 3"), consisting of an unsecured promissory note (the "Promissory Note") and warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Class A Common Stock").

The manager of VBC 3 is Founders GP III, an affiliate of the principal stockholder of the Company.

The members of VBC 3 (the "VBC 3 Investors") are:

CPF III PT SPV, LLC 70.75%
CPF III-A PT SPV, LLC 21.85%
Leavitt Equity Partners III, L.P. 7.40%

Founders UGP III, by virtue of its indirect ownership of (1) the manager of VBC 3 and (2) each of CPF III PT SPV, LLC and CPF III-A PT SPV, LLC, entities holding an aggregate of 92.6% of the membership interests in VBC 3, controls the voting and dispositive decisions with respect to the Warrants and the underlying 92.6% of such shares of Class A Common Stock.

Warrants

In connection with the Promissory Note, on December 12, 2024, P3 LLC and VBC 3 entered into a Warrant (the "Warrant Agreement"). Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, P3 LLC issued warrants to purchase 71,406,480 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.2137 per share (the "Warrants") to VBC 3. The number of shares of Common Stock for which the Warrant is exercisable and the exercise price may be adjusted upon any event involving subdivisions, combinations, distributions, recapitalizations and like transactions. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants and the right to purchase securities upon the exercise of the Warrants will terminate upon the earliest to occur of the following: (a) December 12, 2031; and (b) the consummation of (i) a sale, conveyance, disposal, or encumbrance of all or substantially all of the Company's or P3 LLC's property or business or the Company's or P3 LLC's merger into or consolidation with any other corporation (other than a wholly owned subsidiary corporation) or (ii) any other transaction or series of related transactions in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the Company or P3 LLC is disposed of.

Promissory Note

The Promissory Note was issued by P3 LLC to VBC 3 on December 12, 2024, and provides for funding of up to $25.0 million (the "Promissory Note"), available for draw by P3 LLC in two tranches, as follows: (i) a first tranche of $15.0 million available to P3 LLC upon the Effective Date, and (ii) a second tranche of up to $10.0 million available at the Company's sole option in a single draw, on or prior to December 31, 2024. The maturity date of the Promissory Note is June 30, 2028. Interest is payable at 19.5 % per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears) beginning March 31, 2025. P3 LLC may elect to pay interest 11.5% in kind and 8.0% in cash, but if the terms of the Subordination Agreement (as defined below) do not permit P3 LLC to pay interest in cash, interest will be paid entirely in-kind. The Promissory Note may be prepaid, at the Company's option, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, at any time and from time to time, subject to the payment of the back-end fee described below; provided that prepayments must be in increments of at least $1.25 million. The Promissory Note provides for mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset sales, and VBC 3 has the right to demand payment in full upon (i) a change of control of the Company and (ii) certain qualified financings (as defined in the Promissory Note).

The Promissory Note restricts P3 LLC's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments and restricted payments. The maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event occurs.

Pursuant to the Promissory Note, P3 LLC will pay VBC 3 an up-front fee of 1.5% of the maximum draw amount. In addition, P3 LLC will pay VBC 3 a back-end fee at the time the Promissory Note is prepaid as follows: (i) if paid prior to January 31, 2025, 2.25%; (ii) if paid from February 1, 2025 through April 20, 2025, 4.5%; (iii) if paid from May 1, 2025 through July 31, 2025, 6.75% and (iv) if paid on August 1, 2025 or later, 9.0%.

P3 LLC intends to use the proceeds of the Promissory Note to fund the Company's ongoing working capital requirements.</transactionPurpose>

        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following:

The ownership percentages set forth below are calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Act and are based on an aggregate of 162,863,298 shares of Class A Common Stock and 195,956,984 shares of Class V Common Stock outstanding as of November 1, 2024, based on the number of securities outstanding as contained in the most recently available filing with the SEC by the Issuer. The shares of Class V Common Stock are redeemable at the Reporting Person's option for the Issuer's Class A Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis subject to certain restrictions. The shares of Class V and Class A Common Stock vote as a single class.

As previously disclosed, Founders UGP is the general partner of Founders GP, the general partner of each of Founders Fund LP, Fund-A, and Fund-B. Founders UGP is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities of the Issuer held directly by each of Founders GP, Founders Fund LP, Founders Fund-A, and Founders Fund B.

As previously disclosed, VBC Growth SPV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("VBC"), holds warrants to purchase 429,180 shares of Class A Common Stock (the "Warrant Shares"), and the sole manager of VBC is CPF VBC Growth Aggregator, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of Founders UGP. Founders UGP, by virtue of its indirect ownership of (1) the sole manager of VBC and (2) each of Founders Fund LP and CPF VBC Growth Aggregator, L.P., entities holding an aggregate of 61.88% of the membership interests in VBC, controls all voting and dispositive decisions with respect to the Warrant Shares.

Founders UGP III is the general partner of Founders GP III, the sole manager of each of SPV III, SPV III-A, and VBC 3. Founders UGP III is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities of the Issuer held directly by each of SPV III, SPV III-A, and VBC 3.

VBC 3 holds warrants to purchase 71,406,480 shares of Class A Common Stock (the "Warrant Shares"), and the manager of VBC 3 is Founders GP III, a wholly owned subsidiary of Founders UGP III.

The Fund I Reporting Persons and the Fund III Reporting Persons may be deemed to have formed a "group" for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for purposes of beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Class V Common Stock described above. However, neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that any Fund I Reporting Person or any Fund III Reporting Person who currently beneficially own any shares of Class A Common Stock or any shares of Class V Common Stock are members of any such group. Each Fund III Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership over any shares of Class A Common Stock or any shares of Class V Common Stock beneficially owned by any Fund I Reporting Person, and each Fund I Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership over any shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by any Fund III Reporting Person.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
