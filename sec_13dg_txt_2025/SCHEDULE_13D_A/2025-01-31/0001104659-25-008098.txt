        <commentText>EXPLANATORY NOTE - This Amendment No. 4 to the statement on Schedule 13D (this "Amendment") amends the Schedule 13D originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed on November 25, 2024, Amendment No. 2 filed on December 17, 2024 and Amendment No. 3 filed on December 26, 2024 (as so amended prior to the date hereof, the "Original Schedule 13D" and, as amended by this Amendment, the "Schedule 13D"), which relates to the ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share (the "Ordinary Shares"), of Vertical Aerospace Ltd., a Cayman islands exempted company incorporated with limited liability (the "Issuer"). Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Original Schedule 13D. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Item of the Original Schedule 13D remains unchanged. All share numbers reported in this Amendment give effect to the Issuer's one-for-ten reverse stock split of its Ordinary Shares effected on September 20, 2024.</commentText>

      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 is hereby amended by amending and restating the second paragraph of the Original Schedule 13D as follows:

On January 30, 2025, SF resigned from the Issuer's board of directors (the "Board") and the Vertical Aerospace Group Limited's ("VAGL") board of directors (the "VAGL Board").  SF's resignation from the Board and the VAGL Board does not affect the underlying rights under the December 2024 Transaction Documents (as defined in the Original Schedule 13D) of SF to serve on the Board and the VAGL Board so long as any of the SF Parties beneficially owns more than 3% of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares and, at any future time at which SF holds a directorship position, to appoint one representative (who may act and vote on behalf of SF by way of proxy) for meetings of the Board or the VAGL Board, as applicable, if SF is unable to attend a meeting of the Board or the VAGL Board, respectively.</transactionPurpose>
