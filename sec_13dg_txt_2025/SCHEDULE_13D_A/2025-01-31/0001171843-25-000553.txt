        <transactionPurpose>The reporting person acquired 402,439 ordinary shares, in an exempt private offering, at $4.10 per share, by agreement dated January 23, 2025, as an investment, to provide operating capital to the issuer, Portage Biotech Inc.

The securities currently held and that were acquired as reported herein, are being held for investment purposes. The Reporting Person intends to review his investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis and will routinely monitor a wide variety of investment considerations, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices for the Ordinary Shares, the Issuer's financial position, operations, assets, prospects, strategic direction and business and other developments affecting the Issuer. The Reporting Person may from time to time take such actions with respect to his investment in the Issuer as he deems appropriate, including, without limitation, (i) acquiring additional Ordinary Shares or disposing of some or all of his Ordinary Shares (or other securities of the Issuer), including exercising of outstanding options; (ii) changing his current intentions with respect to any or all matters referred to in this Item 4; and/or (iii) engaging in hedging, derivative or similar transactions with respect to any securities of the Issuer. The Reporting Person may propose and encourage the Issuer to engage in acquisition and disposition transactions and to enter into financing transactions that may change the capitalization of the Issuer. For example, the Issuer may need to raise additional capital, and the Reporting Person may decide to participate in a financing of the Issuer. Any acquisition or disposition of the Issuer's securities may be made by means of open-market purchases or dispositions, privately negotiated transactions, or direct acquisitions from or dispositions to the Issuer.

At the date of this Schedule 13D, except as set forth in this Schedule 13D and publicly announced by the Issuer, the Reporting Person does not have any plans or proposals which would result in:

(a) The acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer, or the disposition of securities of the Issuer;
(b) An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;
(c) A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or of any of its subsidiaries;
(d) Any change in the present board of directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board;
(e) Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer;
(f) Any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure;
(g) Changes in the Issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person;
(h) Causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;
(i) A class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or
(j) Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.</transactionPurpose>
