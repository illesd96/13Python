(the "Issuer") held directly by Mr. You, (ii) 237,956 shares of Class A Common Stock held by RHY Irrevocable Trust (the "Trust"), (iii) 564,375 shares of Class A Common Stock held by Berto LLC ("Berto"), a limited liability company of which Mr. You is the sole member, (iv) 23,101 shares of the Issuer's Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class B Common Stock") held by the Trust, and (v) 1,433,892 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the cash exercise of vested options held by Mr. You. Mr. You is the settlor and investment officer of the Trust, and his son is the beneficiary of the Trust. Accordingly, Mr. You may be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in the securities held by the Trust. Mr. You disclaims beneficial ownership of such securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein. The Class B Common Stock is convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock as described under the heading "Description of Holdco's Securities" in the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-283425) and has no expiration date.

Note to Row 13: Based on 7,515,588 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of January 30, 2025 according to records of the Issuer. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, all shares subject to options held by such person were deemed outstanding if such options are currently vested or will vest within 60 days of the date of this report. These shares were not deemed outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.</commentContent>
