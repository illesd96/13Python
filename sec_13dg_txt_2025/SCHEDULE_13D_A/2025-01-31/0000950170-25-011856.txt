      </item1>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

In response to a request from the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, Ms. Wojcicki has updated her prior statement about whether Ms. Wojcicki would be open to considering third party takeover proposals for the Issuer:

I had previously stated my intention that I would not be willing to consider third party takeover proposals for the Company. Based on subsequent developments in the interim period since that statement, I am revising my statement to indicate my willingness to consider third party takeover proposals for the Company or other strategic alternatives that may be in the best interests of the Company.
</transactionPurpose>
      </item4>
      <item5>
        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Items 5(a)-(c) of the Schedule 13D are hereby amended and restated as follows:

The LLC is the record and beneficial owner of 4,931,692 shares of Class B Common Stock, which may be converted into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock, representing beneficial ownership of 20.1% of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 69.4% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

The Trust is the sole member of the LLC and therefore may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,931,692 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the LLC, which may be converted into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock, representing beneficial ownership of 20.1% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 69.4% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

Ms. Wojcicki is the sole trustee of the Trust and the President and Chairman of the Board of AWF. Accordingly, Ms. Wojcicki may be deemed the beneficial owner of an aggregate of 5,630,844 shares of Class A Common Stock, consisting of: (a) 58,621 shares of Class A Common Stock held directly by Ms. Wojcicki, (b) 511,622 stock options held directly by Ms. Wojcicki that have vested or will vest within sixty days of the date hereof, (c) 3,909 restricted stock units held directly by Ms. Wojcicki that will vest within sixty days of the date hereof, (d) 4,931,692 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the LLC, which may be converted into the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, and (e) 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock held by AWF, representing beneficial ownership of 22.4% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 69.4% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock; provided, however, the foregoing amounts include Ms. Wojcicki's indirect ownership of (i) 4,931,692 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the LLC and (ii) 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock held by AWF, for which Ms. Wojcicki disclaims beneficial ownership except to the extent of her pecuniary interest therein.

The calculation of the Class A Common Stock beneficial ownership percentages in this Item 5 are based upon (a) 19,640,404 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as provided by the Issuer, and (b) any shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, exercise and/or vesting of Class B Common Stock, stock options, restricted stock units or other convertible securities held by each Reporting Person (including any such securities that have vested or will vest within sixty days of the date hereof), as applicable. The calculation of the Class B Common Stock beneficial ownership percentages are based upon 7,105,086 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as provided by the Issuer.

By virtue of the relationships described herein, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to constitute a "group" within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act. As a member of a group, each Reporting Person may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power with respect to, and therefore beneficially own, the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by members of the group as a whole. The filing of this Statement on Schedule 13D shall not be construed as an admission that the Reporting Persons beneficially own those securities held by another member of such group. In addition, each Reporting Person expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any securities reported herein except to the extent such Reporting Person actually exercises voting or dispositive power with respect to such securities.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>The LLC, the Trust (as the sole member of the LLC), and Ms. Wojcicki (as the sole trustee of the Trust) have shared power to vote and dispose, or direct the disposition, of 4,931,692 shares of the Class B Common Stock held by the LLC. Additionally, the LLC is manager-managed and the manager from time to time may exercise voting power with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock held by the LLC.

Ms. Wojcicki, as the President and Chairman of the Board of AWF, has shared power to vote and dispose, or direct the disposition, of 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock held by AWF. AWF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization; its address is 171 Main Street, Suite 259, Los Altos, California 94022. During the last five years, AWF has not been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).
