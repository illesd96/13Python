        <transactionPurpose>Pursuant to the terms of the Pentwater Support Agreement, the Pentwater Funds tendered the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired as scheduled at one minute following 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on January 7, 2025. The shares of Common Stock held by the Pentwater Funds were accepted for payment on January 8, 2025. As a result, the Reporting Persons no longer own, beneficially or otherwise, any securities of the Issuer.

In addition, on January 8, 2025, following consummation of the Tender Offer, Merger Sub merged with and into the Issuer, with the Issuer being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). Accordingly, at the effective time of the Merger, the Pentwater Support Agreement terminated pursuant to its terms.</transactionPurpose>
