        <transactionPurpose>The Reporting Persons purchased the Shares for investment purposes.
The Reporting Persons are continuing to review the performance of
their investment and their investment alternatives.  As part of their
ongoing review of their investment in the Shares, the Reporting Persons
may explore from time to time a variety of alternatives, including the
acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition
of securities of the Issuer in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions.  The Reporting Persons may explore other alternatives with
respect to their investment in the Shares, including but not limited to
an extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer, changes in
the present board of directors or management of the Issuer, or changes in
the Issuer's business or corporate structure.  Although the foregoing
reflects activities presently contemplated by the Reporting Person with
respect to the Issuer, the foregoing is subject to change at any time,
and there can be no assurance that the Reporting Persons will take any
of the actions referred to above.

         Except as set forth in the preceding paragraphs, as of the date hereof,
         the Reporting Persons do not have any plan or proposal that relates to
         or would result in:

         (a) The acquisition by any person of additional securities of the
         Issuer, or the disposition of securities of the Issuer;

         (b) An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
         reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its
         subsidiaries;

         (c) A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or
         any of its subsidiaries;

         (d) Any change in the present board of directors or management of the
         Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term
         of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board;

         (e) Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend
         policy of the Issuer;

         (f) Any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate
         structure;

         (g) Changes in the Issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments
         corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition
         of control of the Issuer by any person;

         (h) Causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a
         national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted
         in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities
         association;

         (i) A class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for
         termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or

         (j) Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reporting Persons reserve the right
         to effect any such actions as they may deem necessary or appropriate in
         the future.

         The information set forth in Item 3 of this Schedule 13D is hereby
         incorporated herein by reference.
