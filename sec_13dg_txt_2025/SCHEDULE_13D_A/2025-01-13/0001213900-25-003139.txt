The amounts of voting power reflect the assumed prior conversion of the Class A Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons (as defined below) into Class B Ordinary Shares.

For box 13
The denominator of the fraction upon which this percentage is calculated is based on 14,475,000 Class B Ordinary Shares outstanding, which is adjusted to include (i) the 12,225,000 Class B Ordinary Shares outstanding as of January 13, 2025, and (ii) the 2,250,000 Class B Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of the Class A Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by Pinehurst Partners LLC.
