<commentText>Pursuant to Rule 13d-2(a) under the Act, this Amendment No. 4 to the Schedule 13D ("Amendment No. 4") amends certain items of the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Person with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on November 8, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated December 9, 2024, Amendment No. 2 dated December 13, 2024, and Amendment No. 3 dated December 18, 2024 (collectively, the "Schedule 13D"), relating to the shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of ModivCare, Inc. All capitalized terms contained herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Schedule 13D. Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment No. 4 does not modify any of the information previously reported in the Schedule 13D.</commentText>
</item1>
<item3>
<fundsSource>Item 3 is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be, as follows: &#13;
&#13;
QGCM has not expended any of its funds for purchases of the Common Stock reported herein. QGCM, however, expended $18,398,383.42 (excluding commissions and fees) of the funds of Q5-R5 Trading, Ltd. ("Q5") to purchase the shares of the Common Stock reported herein (the "Shares").</fundsSource>
</item3>
<item4>
<transactionPurpose>Item 4 is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be, as follows:&#13;
 &#13;
As previously announced by the Issuer, on January 9, 2025, the Issuer entered into, among other transactions, a transaction to raise $75 million of additional financing under its existing term loan (the "Financing Transaction") and entered into Amendment No 5. to its Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2022, as amended (the "Fifth Amendment"), and an Exchange Agreement, dated January 9, 2025 (the "Exchange Agreement").  In connection with the Financing Transaction, and as described in the Fifth Amendment and the Exchange Agreement in more detail, Q5 has agreed to exchange up to $29,110,000 of the principal amount of the Issuer's 5.000% Senior Notes due in 2029 (the "Senior Notes") held by Q5 for the corresponding principal amount of second lien senior secured PIK toggle notes to be issued by the Issuer, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement.  &#13;
 &#13;
The foregoing descriptions of the Fifth Amendment and the Exchange Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Fifth Amendment and Exchange Agreement, which are incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. &#13;
 &#13;
The terms of the Financing Transaction deliver on the requests previously made by the Reporting Person and described in this Schedule 13D, as amended.  For example, the Reporting Person requested that the Issuer replace Mr. Shackelton as Chairman of the Issuer's board, which has occurred.  In addition, the Reporting Person requested that four directors be replaced, and the terms of the Financing Transaction will result in three directors being appointed by the Issuer's investors.  The Reporting Person also requested that the Issuer evaluate its financial leadership team, and the Issuer has appointed Mr. Shandler from FTI as Chief Transformation Officer. Finally, the Reporting Person sought for the Issuer to shorten its timeline to review strategic alternatives, which is also now required under the terms of the Financing Transaction.  &#13;
 &#13;
As a result of these changes, the Reporting Person no longer seeks to influence the management of the Issuer and is now holding the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer for investment purposes only.  In light of this shift to holding the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer for investment purposes only, the Reporting Person has reduced the size of its investment in the Common Stock of the Issuer.</transactionPurpose>
</item4>
<item5>
<percentageOfClassSecurities>Item 5(a) is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
REPORTING PERSON&#13;
&#13;
QGCM&#13;
Because of its position as the sole Investment manager of Q5, QGCM may, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Act, be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,221,933 Shares, which constitute approximately 8.55% of the 14,283,664 Shares outstanding.&#13;
&#13;

QGA&#13;
Because of its position as the sole general partner of QGCM, QGA may, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Act, be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,221,933 Shares, which constitute approximately 8.55% of the 14,283,664 Shares outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
RS&#13;
Because of its position as the sole manager of QGA, RS may, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Act, be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,221,933 Shares, which constitute approximately 8.55% of the 14,283,664 Shares outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
Raynor&#13;
Since Raynor controls and indirectly wholly owns RS, which is the sole manager of QGA, Raynor may, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Act, be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,221,933 Shares, which constitute approximately 8.55% of the 14,283,664 Shares outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
To the best of the knowledge of the Reporting Persons, other than as set forth above, none of the Item 2 Persons is the beneficial owner of any Shares.</percentageOfClassSecurities>

In connection with the Financing Transaction, TEB is a party to the Fifth Amendment and has agreed to backstop the Financing Transaction in a principal amount of up to approximately $4,800,000.&#13;
  &#13;
The Fifth Amendment is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. &#13;

The Exchange Agreement is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.</contractDescription>
