        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The information contained on the cover pages is incorporated by reference to this Item 5.

The ownership information set forth herein represents beneficial ownership of Class A Common Stock as of the date of this Schedule 13D, the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and percentage of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by each of the Reporting Persons as of the date hereof, based on 9,926,412 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of November 5, 2024, as set forth in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the Issuer on November 8, 2024.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
        <numberOfShares>The information contained on the cover pages is incorporated by reference to this Item 5.

Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc. is the record holder of 179,261 shares of Class A Common Stock and 2,574,607 FOAEC Units, as reported herein. Mr. Jahangiri is the majority shareholder of Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc. and may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the securities held by Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc. The percent of class beneficially owned as reported above gives effect to the Conversion Agreement as previously disclosed in Item 4.

Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc. will be issued FOAEC Units only to the extent that its ownership does not exceed 9.49% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (giving effect to the deemed exchange of all outstanding FOAEC Units) until, among other conditions, certain consents, approvals, authorizations and waivers are satisfied (the "Control Condition"). Each FOAEC Unit is exchangeable into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis at the option of the holder.</numberOfShares>
