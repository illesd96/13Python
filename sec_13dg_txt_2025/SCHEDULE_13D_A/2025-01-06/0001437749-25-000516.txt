        <commentContent>Rows 7, 9 and 11: Includes (i) 263,432 shares of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation's (the Issuer) common stock held directly by David G. Hanna and (ii) 1,000 shares of the Issuer's common stock underlying a stock option award that is currently exercisable.

David G. Hanna shares voting and dispositive power over the 4,000,000 shares of the Issuer's common stock underlying Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by Dove with his brother Frank J. Hanna. The governing documents for DKH provide Kimberly M. Hanna with sole voting and dispositive power over the 3,573,072 shares of common stock held by DKH. Given Mr. Hanna's position as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, this Amendment No. 5 to Schedule 13D (this Amendment) attributes shared voting and dispositive power for these shares of common stock to David G. Hanna and Kimberly M. Hanna. Bravo Two Company, Inc. (Bravo) is the trustee for the Rainbow Trust. David G. Hanna is the President, Secretary, and Treasurer and the sole owner of Bravo.

Row 11: Excludes 3,598,072 shares of the Issuer's common stock that have been pledged to an entity controlled by David G. Hanna (the Pledgee) to secure a loan to an entity controlled by Frank J. Hanna and members of Frank J. Hanna's immediate family. The pledge agreement, prior to default, does not grant to the Pledgee (i) the power to vote or to direct the vote of the pledged shares or (ii) the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the pledged shares.

Row 13: Based on 14,738,862 shares of the Issuer's common stock outstanding as of October 29, 2024, as reported in the Issuer's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 7, 2024. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which deem a person to beneficially own any shares of the Issuer's common stock the person has or shares voting or dispositive power over and any additional shares of the Issuer's common stock obtainable within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of preferred stock, options or other purchase rights. Shares of the Issuer's common stock subject to preferred stock, options or other purchase rights that are currently exercisable or are exercisable within 60 days of November 19, 2024 (including shares subject to restrictions that lapse within 60 days of November 19, 2024) are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such preferred stock, options or other purchase rights, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.</commentContent>

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

As previously disclosed in the Issuer's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on December 30, 2019, the Issuer and Dove entered into a payoff letter (the Payoff Letter), pursuant to which the Issuer agreed to issue Dove 400,000 shares of newly-created Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value (the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock), in exchange for full satisfaction of the $40.0 million that the Issuer owed Dove under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014, as previously amended, among the Issuer, certain subsidiary guarantors of the Issuer and Dove. The Issuer and Dove signed the Payoff Letter and completed the transactions provided for under the Payoff Letter on December 27, 2019.

In connection with the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, on December 27, 2019, the Issuer filed the Articles of Amendment Establishing Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the Articles of Amendment) with the Georgia Secretary of State. The Articles of Amendment, which establishes the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations relating to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, became effective upon filing.

Pursuant to the Articles of Amendment, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has the following terms:

Liquidation Preference: The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ranks (i) senior in liquidation to all existing and future classes of the Issuer's common stock and (ii) pari passu or senior to all existing and future classes of preferred stock.

Per Share Liquidation Preference: $100.

Dividends: 6% per year, cumulative, non-compounding, on the liquidation preference of $100.

Redemption: The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on or after January 1, 2025 at a redemption price equal to $100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.  At the request of a majority of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Issuer shall offer to redeem all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to $100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, at the option of the holders thereof, on or after January 1, 2024.

Conversion: Upon the election by the holders of a majority of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into the number of shares of the Issuer's common stock as is determined by dividing (i) the sum of (a) $100 and (b) any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such share by (ii) an initial conversion price equal to $10 per share, subject to certain adjustment in certain circumstances to prevent dilution.

Voting Rights: Except for approval of adverse changes to the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, approval of sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets, and triggering redemption or conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights except as required by law.

The terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are more fully described in the Articles of Amendment, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

Hanna is the sole shareholder and the President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of one of the trusts the beneficiaries of which include David G. Hanna.
