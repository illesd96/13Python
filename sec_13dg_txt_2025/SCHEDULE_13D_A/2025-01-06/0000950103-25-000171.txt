        <commentText>This Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3") amends and supplements the statement on Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 1, 2023 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed on October 24, 2023 and Amendment No. 2 thereto filed on December 19, 2024, the "Schedule 13D") with respect to shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (the "Issuer").

Unless indicated otherwise, all items left blank remain unchanged and any items which are reported are deemed to amend and supplement the existing items in the Schedule 13D. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Amendment No. 3 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D.</commentText>

        <fundsSource>The description of the Proposal set forth in Item 4 below is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 3. It is anticipated that funding for the cash portion of the consideration payable pursuant to the Proposal will be obtained from the Reporting Person's working capital, debt and equity financing sources and/or other financing sources.</fundsSource>
      </item3>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>On December 9, 2024, the Issuer announced its entry into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "A&amp;R Merger Agreement") with Crown Laboratories, Inc. and Reb Merger Sub, Inc. (collectively, "Crown"), pursuant to which Crown commenced a tender offer on December 12, 2024 to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at a price of $3.10 per share (the transactions contemplated by the A&amp;R Merger Agreement, the "Proposed Transaction").

The Reporting Person believes that the Proposed Transaction undervalues the Issuer and that the consummation of the Proposed Transaction is not in the best interests of the Issuer or its stockholders.

On January 6, 2025, the Reporting Person submitted a proposal (the "Proposal") to the chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer of the Issuer proposing a transaction (the "Proposed Transaction") pursuant to which the Reporting Person would purchase all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that are not beneficially owned by the Reporting Person at a price of $3.60 per share.

The Proposed Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, any applicable regulatory approvals, the negotiation and execution of definitive transaction documents and the satisfactory completion of confirmatory due diligence.

The Proposal is non-binding in nature, constitutes a preliminary indication of interest and does not obligate the Reporting Person or the Issuer to negotiate or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction. No assurances can be given that a definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction will be entered into or whether the Proposed Transaction will be consummated.

The Proposed Transaction could result in one or more of the actions specified in clauses (a)-(j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, including the acquisition or disposition of additional securities of the Issuer, an extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer, a change to the present board of directors of the Issuer, and a material change to the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer. The Reporting Person is expected to take actions in furtherance of the Proposed Transaction set forth in the Proposal or any amendment thereof.

The Reporting Persons may at any time, or from time to time, acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose of their shares of Common Stock, propose, pursue, or choose not to pursue the Proposed Transaction; change the terms of the Proposed Transaction, including the price, conditions, or scope of the Proposed Transaction; take any action in or out of the ordinary course of business to facilitate or increase the likelihood of consummation of the Proposed Transaction; otherwise seek control or seek to influence the management and policies of the Issuer; or change their intentions with respect to any such matters.

The foregoing description of the Proposal does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Proposal which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 4.

On January 6, 2025, the Reporting Person issued a press release in connection with the Proposal, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 4.</transactionPurpose>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Teoxane SA is pleased
to submit this proposal (&ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of of Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (&ldquo;Revance&rdquo;

commercial and distribution partnership between our companies has faced meaningful challenges in recent years. Most recently, we entered
into the Sixth Amendment to our Distribution Agreement, which reflects our commitment to continuing the partnership on mutually workable
economic and contractual terms. Regardless of these challenges, we continue to see strategic value in Revance&rsquo;s product portfolio,
and in your sales &amp; distribution in the US medical aesthetics sector. Furthermore, as shareholders, we do not support Revance&rsquo;s
proposed sale to Crown Laboratories, Inc. (&ldquo;Crown&rdquo;) at $3.10 per share (the &ldquo;Crown Proposal&rdquo;), which we believe
undervalues the Company, and we are pleased to present the Company and our fellow shareholders with a superior, attractive and actionable
alternative.</FONT></P>

our evaluation of publicly available information and our knowledge of Revance&rsquo;s operations and capabilities via our existing commercial
relationship (considering that Teoxane&rsquo;s products represent a material portion of Revance&rsquo;s current and prospective revenues
under our existing Distribution Agreement, and that we have partnered together for nearly five years).</FONT></P>

our valuation, deliver a definitive, binding proposal and execute a merger agreement with Revance, we and our financing sources will
require expedited access to confirmatory due diligence, following the Revance Board&rsquo;s confirmation that this Proposal is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the existing merger agreement with Crown). Given our existing business relationship
and familiarity with the Company, as well as the clear strategic and commercial rationale, we are highly confident that we can complete
our work, in parallel with negotiating definitive documentation in an expedited manner, assuming that we receive access to information
promptly. We are prepared to immediately enter into an update of our existing non-disclosure agreement in order to facilitate this work.
Our due diligence will be targeted and will be focused on confirming and updating our understanding of Revance&rsquo;s current sales
trajectory, operational expense structure, cash burn, transaction/change-of-control expenses and litigation exposures. Our internal and
external advisory teams are fully engaged and prepared to begin this work immediately. We expect that our lenders will also require access
to customary due diligence in areas such as AML/sanctions, regulatory, corporate structure and ownership/security in key assets.</FONT></P>

the Transaction with a combination of cash on hand, new minority equity at the Teoxane level, and an appropriate amount of debt, considering
our attractive profitability and cash flow profile. We have strong relationships with numerous lenders, several of which are already
in dialog with us on this opportunity, and are confident we will secure financing commitments on an expedited basis. Furthermore, we
are already in discussion with several equity partners that have been familiar with Teoxane and our sector for some time, and are prepared
to complete due diligence alongside us to fund the equity portion of the purchase price. We have retained Jefferies as our exclusive
financial advisor, and have attached a support letter from Jefferies addressing their confidence in arranging the necessary financing.
Customary commitment letters would be obtained at the signing of a Definitive Agreement, which will not contain a financing condition.</FONT></P>

company with a small board, our internal approval process is streamlined and does not include any lengthy corporate board or shareholder
approvals; we are prepared to move forward as expeditiously as possible. Closing the Transaction would be subject to any applicable regulatory
approvals, but we do not anticipate there to be any complications in securing such approvals, noting that Teoxane&rsquo;s US sales are
already conducted effectively entirely through Revance&rsquo;s platform, and there are no other known geographical or portfolio overlaps
today.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>GENEVA, January 6, 2025 &ndash;</B>
Teoxane SA today announced that on January 6, 2025, it submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:
RVNC) to acquire Revance for $3.60 per share in cash. Teoxane beneficially owns 6.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Revance.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Teoxane&rsquo;s proposal provides a 16%
premium over the $3.10 per share price in Revance&rsquo;s amended and restated merger agreement with Crown Laboratories, Inc. (&ldquo;Crown&rdquo;),
as announced on December 9, 2024. Teoxane believes its proposal is a superior alternative to the amended and restated transaction with
Crown.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Teoxane has organized the resources to
work as expeditiously as possible toward a transaction with Revance and is prepared to transact promptly. Teoxane has performed due diligence
with publicly available information and would have only limited and specific confirmatory due diligence requirements. Teoxane already
possesses deep knowledge of Revance&rsquo;s operations and capabilities via its existing commercial relationship: Teoxane&rsquo;s products
represent a material portion of Revance&rsquo;s current and prospective revenues under the companies&rsquo; existing Distribution Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Closing the transaction would be subject
to any applicable regulatory approvals, but Teoxane does not anticipate any significant regulatory risks or delays, and notes that Teoxane&rsquo;s
U.S. sales are already conducted effectively entirely through Revance&rsquo;s platform, and that there are no other known geographical
or portfolio overlaps today.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Teoxane has substantial cash on hand,
is highly profitable, and together with its financial advisor is already in discussions with financing sources that are familiar with
Teoxane and the sector in order to secure committed financing for the transaction in a timely manner, in parallel with the completion
of due diligence. Teoxane will obtain fully underwritten, binding commitment letters prior to signing a definitive agreement, which will
not contain a financing contingency.</FONT></P>
