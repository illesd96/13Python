The number of shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons, on a combined basis, represented 20.85% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer as of July 31, 2024 (based upon information contained in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024).
