On September 5, 2023, Luxco and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International PLC ("MSIP") entered into a contingent share sale and purchase transaction (as amended from time to time, the "Contingent Share Purchase Agreement"). The Contingent Share Purchase Agreement provides for the purchase of 283,508,077 Ordinary Shares by Luxco from MSIP. The purchase is conditional on, among other things, the receipt of all relevant foreign direct investment approvals, and if applicable, merger control approvals. The purchase price per share is based on the official closing price of the shares on the relevant Spanish exchange at the time of entry into the Contingent Share Purchase Agreement. Luxco will fund the purchase of such Ordinary Shares using funds on hand.</fundsSource>

        <transactionPurpose>The Reporting Persons acquired the securities reported herein for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons intend to evaluate this investment in the Issuer on an ongoing basis and may take such actions with respect to their investment in the Issuer as they deem appropriate.

The Reporting Persons may acquire additional Ordinary Shares and/or other securities of the Issuer in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise and may also, depending on the current circumstances, dispose of all or a portion of the Ordinary Shares or other securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by them in one or more transactions.

The Reporting Persons reserve the right to change their purpose and to formulate and implement plans or proposals with respect to the Issuer at any time. Any such action may be made by a Reporting Person alone or in conjunction with the other Reporting Persons, other shareholders, potential acquirers, financing sources and/or other third parties and could include one or more purposes, plans or proposals that relate to or would result in actions required to be reported herein in accordance with Item 4 of Schedule 13D.</transactionPurpose>

        <contractDescription>On September 5, 2023, Luxco entered into an equity collar transaction with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. which comprises a series of pairs of a purchased put option and sold call option with respect to 9.97% of the share capital of the Issuer (the "Equity Collar Transaction").

The default settlement method for each pair of a put option and call option is cash settlement although Luxco can elect to make physical delivery of the Ordinary Shares.
