The SPI Agreement provided that, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of the SPI Agreement, (i) the Issuer will acquire from the Reporting Person over three closings, on December 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, and March 31, 2025, a total of 51.73% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Juve Stabia, (ii) the Issuer will pay the Reporting Person an aggregate purchase price of EUR3,000,000 using a combination of cash and the issuance of Class B Ordinary Shares, and (iii) the Issuer will increase the share capital of Juve Stabia by an aggregate amount of EUR1,500,000 at each closing.

On January 10, 2025, the Issuer entered into a restated sale and purchase and investment agreement (the "Restated SPI Agreement") with the Reporting Person, which amended the SPI Agreement. The Restated SPI Agreement provided that, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Restated SPI Agreement, (i) the Issuer will acquire from the Reporting Person over four closings, on December 31, 2024, January 10, 2025, January 31, 2025, and March 31, 2025, a total of 51.73% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Juve Stabia, (ii) the Issuer will pay the Reporting Person an aggregate purchase price of EUR3,000,000 using a combination of cash and the issuance of Class B Ordinary Shares, and (iii) the Issuer will increase the share capital of Juve Stabia by an aggregate amount of EUR4,500,000. As stated above, on December 31, 2024, the Issuer issued the Reporting Person EUR1,000,000 in Class B Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.65 for a total of 1,600,000 Class B Ordinary Shares, and paid Juve Stabia EUR500,000 in cash and issued EUR1,000,000 in Class B Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.65 for a total of 1,600,000 Class B Ordinary Shares.

On January 10, 2025, the Issuer issued the Reporting Person EUR500,000 in Class B Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.65 for a total of 800,000 Class B Ordinary Shares, and paid Juve Stabia EUR500,000 in cash and issued EUR1,000,000 in Class B Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.65 for a total of 1,600,000 Class B Ordinary Shares.

On January 31, 2025, the Issuer will pay the Reporting Person EUR500,000 in cash. On March 31, 2025, the Issuer will pay the Reporting Person EUR500,000 in cash and issue EUR500,000 in Class B Ordinary Shares at a price per share equal to the volume-weighted average price of the Class B Ordinary Shares, calculated over the 15 trading days immediately preceding the second business day preceding March 31, 2025, and pay Juve Stabia EUR1,500,000 in cash.

In addition, the Reporting Person may, from time to time, transfer shares beneficially owned by it for tax, estate or other economic planning purposes. The Reporting Person reserves the right to acquire additional securities of the Issuer in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions (which may be with the Issuer or with third parties) or otherwise, to dispose of all or a portion of its holdings of securities of the Issuer or to change its intention with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this Item 4.</transactionPurpose>
