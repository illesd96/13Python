        <transactionPurpose>The Common Stock reported in this Schedule 13D was acquired by the Reporting Persons in exchange for indebtedness of the Debtor (as defined below) in connection with the emergence from bankruptcy proceedings of the Issuer, as described below.

On November 13, 2024, Vroom, Inc. (in the context of the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, the "Debtor") commenced a voluntary proceeding (the "Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case") under Chapter 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101-1532, as amended from time to time, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the "Court") under the name "In re Vroom, Inc."

On January 8, 2025, the Court entered an order (the "Confirmation Order") confirming a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the "Plan") of the Debtor. On January 14, 2025 (the "Effective Date"), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtor emerged from the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the Confirmation Order, the Debtor's common stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Date was canceled and is of no further force or effect, and the new organizational documents of the Issuer became effective, authorizing the issuance of shares of Common Stock representing 100% of the equity interests in the Issuer. In accordance with the foregoing, on the Effective Date, the Issuer, as reorganized on the Effective Date in accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order, issued (i) 5,163,109 shares of Common Stock, which included 3,952,231 shares of Common Stock, in the aggregate, issued to certain of the Reporting Persons in respect of the Debtor's 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (as further described herein), and (ii) warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 364,516 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $60.95 per share for a 5-year period commencing on the Effective Date.

Accordingly, pursuant to the Plan, the Reporting Persons, as holders of the Debtor's 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, received Common Stock comprising approximately 76.5% of the Common Stock of the Issuer outstanding immediately following the Effective Date. The shares of Common Stock directly held by the Reporting Persons include: 1,058,822 by Global LP; 725,385 by Drawdown II; 67,695 by Drawdown II SC; 44,005 by Drawdown III; 200,657 by DISL; 181,163 by SIF; and 1,674,504 by certain accounts managed by MCM.

In connection with the Issuer's emergence from the Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case, Matthew Pietroforte, a managing director of MCM, was appointed to serve on the board of directors of the Issuer (the "Board") on January 14, 2025.

The shares of Common Stock reported herein are held by the Reporting Persons for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons intend to review their investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis and consider such other factors relevant to the Reporting Persons, which could include the price and availability of the Common Stock, the Issuer's business and the Issuer's prospects, applicable legal, contractual or policy restrictions, prevailing market conditions, other investment opportunities, tax considerations, liquidity requirements of such Reporting Person and/or other investment considerations. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any or all of the Reporting Persons (in each case, subject to any applicable restrictions under law) may at any time or from time to time (i) sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its Common Stock in public or private transactions, including in registered offerings, through block trades or open market transactions, (ii) purchase, receive in a distribution or other transfer, or otherwise acquire (including in respect of any equity compensation paid to Mr. Pietroforte) Common Stock in public or private transactions, (iii) enter into derivatives or hedging transactions relating to Common Stock, and/or (iv) enter into agreements with a broker intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i) under the Act, on such terms and at such time as the Reporting Persons may deem advisable. Subject to the agreements described herein, the Reporting Persons, at any time and from time to time, may review, reconsider and change their position and/or change their purpose and/or develop such plans and seek to influence management or the Board with respect to the business and affairs of the Issuer and may from time to time consider pursuing or proposing such matters with advisors, the Issuer or other persons.</transactionPurpose>
