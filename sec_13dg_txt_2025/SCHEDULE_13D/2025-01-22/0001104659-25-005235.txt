        <percentageOfClassSecurities>Mr. Palmisano has sole investment or voting power with respect to 2,265,000 shares of Common Stock held by The Palmisano Family, LLC, of which Mr. Palmisano is the sole manager.  In aggregate, The Palmisano Family, LLC and Mr. Palmisano may be deemed to beneficially own 2,265,000 shares of Common Stock, which reflects an approximate 5.67% beneficial ownership of the Company (based upon 39,970,693 shares outstanding as of November 11, 2024, as reported in Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 13, 2024).

Excluded from Mr. Palmisano' beneficial ownership are 36,021 shares of Common Stock underlying an award of restricted stock units, relating to 36,021 shares of Class A Common Stock, granted on August 31, 2024 (the "Grant Date"), which vests in full on the second anniversary of the Grant Date, related to and subject to his continued service to the Issuer through the applicable vesting date (the "RSU Award").

Such shares underlying the RSU Award are reported as shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Palmisano in his Section 16 reports pursuant to applicable provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and positions taken by the SEC; however, such RSUs do not vest within 60 days of the date of this Schedule 13D and are therefore not included as beneficially owned by Mr. Palmisano in this Schedule 13D.</percentageOfClassSecurities>
