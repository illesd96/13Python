        <fundsSource>On November 14, 2024, Luckview entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the "ZEEKR Sale and Purchase Agreement") with Geely International (Hong Kong) Limited ("GIHK"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Geely Holding, pursuant to which GIHK agreed to sell, and Luckview agreed to buy, 300,000,000 Ordinary Shares (the "Sale Shares") for an aggregate consideration of US$806,100,000, or US$26.87 per ADS (reflecting the 15-day volume weighted average price per ADS on the New York Stock Exchange for the 15-trading day period ending on (and including) the last trading day immediately prior to the date of the ZEEKR Sale and Purchase Agreement) (such transaction, the "Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares was completed on December 31, 2024. The consideration of the Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares was funded by the internal cash reserve of Geely Auto and its subsidiaries.

The ZEEKR Sale and Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from each of GIHK (as seller) and Luckview (as buyer) and is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature.

The description of the ZEEKR Sale and Purchase Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 99.2, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Luckview became a registered shareholder of the Issuer prior to the Issuer's initial public offering of ADSs in the United States (the "ZEEKR IPO") in May 2024. Immediately prior to the ZEEKR IPO, Luckview was the registered owner of 1,240,000,000 Ordinary Shares. In the ZEEKR IPO, Luckview subscribed for an additional 129,009,520 Ordinary Shares represented by 12,900,952 ADSs and disposed of 12,660 Ordinary Shares represented by 1,266 ADS on behalf of Geely Auto. The disposition was made to fulfill Geely Auto's assured entitlement obligation to minority shareholders under the Listing Rules of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.</fundsSource>
      </item3>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>The information set forth in Item 3 is hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 4.

This Statement is being filed in connection with the Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares. On December 31, 2024, the date of completion of the Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares, Geely International (Hong Kong) Limited transferred 300,000,000 Ordinary Shares to Luckview Group Limited. Taking into account the Reporting Persons' existing beneficial ownership in the Issuer and the Sale Shares, the Reporting Persons have the power to control and/or dispose Shares representing approximately 66.6% of the total voting power in general shareholders meeting of the Issuer.

The purpose of the Acquisition of ZEEKR Shares is to further demonstrate support for the ZEEKR brand, simplify the Issuer's shareholder structure and enhance influence over the Issuer's strategic direction, thereby facilitating allocation of strategic resources and implementation of future plans, as well as strengthen equity control over the Issuer and help mitigate possible equity dilution in the future.

Additionally, as disclosed on the Form 6-K filed by the Issuer on November 14, 2024, on such date the Issuer entered into strategic integration transactions (the "Strategic Integration Transactions") with certain other entities controlled by Mr. Li, including LYNK &amp; CO Automotive Technology Co., Ltd. ("LYNK &amp; CO"), a Chinese-foreign joint venture in China for which Geely Auto has a 50% indirect ownership interest. Upon the consummation of the Strategic Integration Transactions, LYNK &amp; CO will be owned indirectly as to 51% by the Issuer and 49% by Geely Auto, respectively. The consummation of the Strategic Integration Transactions is subject to a number of contingencies that are beyond the control of the contract parties, including the approval by the independent shareholders of Geely Auto in accordance with the Listing Rules of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

The descriptions of the Reporting Persons' involvement in the Strategic Integration Transactions are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibits 99.3 and 99.4, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Except as set forth in this Item 4 or Item 6 below, the Reporting Persons have no present plans or proposals that relate to or that would result in any of the actions specified in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D of the Act. The Reporting Persons reserve the right to take such actions in the future as they deem appropriate, including changing the purpose described above or adopting plans or proposals with respect to one or more of the items described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.</transactionPurpose>

        <transactionDesc>Except as disclosed in this Statement, none of the Reporting Persons has effected any transaction in the Ordinary Shares during the past 60 days.</transactionDesc>
        <listOfShareholders>Except as disclosed in this Statement, to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons.</listOfShareholders>
        <date5PercentOwnership>Although Geely Auto is a listed company on The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and is managed separately from Mr. Li and his associates, the Reporting Persons, Mr. Li and his associates, and their respective affiliates may be deemed to be members of a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Act in respect of their respective interests in the Ordinary Shares (the "Geely Group"). The Geely Group may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 1,950,996,860 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 77.8% of the Shares issued and outstanding. Each of the Reporting Persons expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by other members of the Geely Group, to the extent such beneficial ownership would be attributable to the Reporting Persons.

The Acquisition of the ZEEKR Shares was completed on December 31, 2024, after Geely International (Hong Kong) Limited transferred 300,000,000 Ordinary Shares to Luckview Group Limited. Taking into account the Reporting Persons' existing holding in the Issuer and the Sale Shares, the Reporting Persons have the power to control and/or dispose Shares representing approximately 66.6% of the total voting power in general shareholders meeting of the Issuer.

The Reporting Persons note that releases and foreign regulatory filings of Geely Auto report their ownership percentage in the Issuer on a fully diluted basis, which results in percentages different from the amounts calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Act. The ownership percentage of Geely Auto in those releases was computed based on a total of 2,657,346,254 Ordinary Shares, including the 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares reserved under the Issuer's 2021 Share Incentive Plan.</date5PercentOwnership>
