        <transactionDesc>Except as reported in this Statement, the Reporting Person has not effected any transactions in the Issuer's securities within the past 60 days. On December 23, 2024, the Reporting Person purchased 555,556 ADSs together with 555,556 Series F Warrants to purchase up to 555,556 ADSs and 555,556 Series G Warrants to purchase up to 555,556 ADSs in the Issuer's public offering. Each ADS was purchased together with a Series F Warrant to purchase one ADS and a Series G Warrant to purchase one ADS at a combined public offering price of $0.45. In addition, as described in Annex A, on December 9, 2024, the Issuer granted Dr. Myers an option to purchase 536,603 ADSs, which option is not exercisable within 60 days of the filing of this Statement.</transactionDesc>
        <listOfShareholders>No other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Person.</listOfShareholders>
        <date5PercentOwnership>Not applicable</date5PercentOwnership>
      </item5>
      <item6>
        <contractDescription>The Series F Warrants and the Series G Warrants have an exercise price of $0.45 per share and were immediately exercisable upon issuance. The Series F Warrants will expire two (2) years from the date of issuance and the Series G Warrants will expire five (5) years from the date of issuance. There is not expected to be any trading market for the Warrants.

The exercise price of the Warrants, and the number of ADSs issuable pursuant to the Warrants, will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization or similar event, as described in the Warrants. In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Ordinary Shares, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets, the Issuer's consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, the holders of the Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental transaction, the Issuer or any successor entity will, at the option of the holder of a Warrant exercisable at any time concurrently with or within 30 days after the consummation of the fundamental transaction (or, if later, the date of the public announcement thereof), purchase the Warrant from the holder by paying to the holder an amount of consideration equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion of such Warrant on the date of consummation of the fundamental transaction based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the Warrants. The consideration paid to the holder will be the same type or form of consideration that was offered and paid to the holders of Ordinary Shares in connection with the fundamental transaction; provided that if no such consideration was offered or paid, the holders of Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have received Ordinary Shares of the successor entity in such fundamental transaction for purposes of this provision of the Warrants.

An investor (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Warrants to the extent that the investor would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the Issuer's outstanding Ordinary Shares immediately after such exercise.

The foregoing summary of the Series F Warrants and the Series G Warrants does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive transaction documents, forms of which are filed as Exhibits A and B, respectively, to this Statement and are each incorporated herein by reference.

Other than as indicated in this Statement, the Reporting Person is not party to any contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer, including but not limited to, the transfer or voting of any of the Issuer's securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies.</contractDescription>
