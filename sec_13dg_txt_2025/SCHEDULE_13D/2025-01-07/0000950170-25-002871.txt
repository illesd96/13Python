<transactionPurpose> Agreement and Plan of Merger

     On December 30, 2024, the Issuer and Vacasa Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer ("Company LLC"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Casago Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), Vista Merger Sub II Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Company Merger Sub"), and Vista Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("LLC Merger Sub" and collectively with Company Merger Sub, the "Merger Subs"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Item 5 have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 3. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (a) LLC Merger Sub will merge with and into Company LLC (the "LLC Merger"), with Company LLC surviving the LLC Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (b) Company Merger Sub will merge with and into the Issuer (the "Company Merger" and together with the LLC Merger, the "Mergers"), with the Issuer surviving the Company Merger.

     At the effective time of the Company Merger (the "Company Merger Effective Time"), (a) each share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $5.02 in cash, without interest, subject to potential downward adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (as adjusted, the "Merger Consideration"), and (b) each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Issuer (the "Class B Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will automatically be canceled and cease to exist. At the effective time of the LLC Merger (the "LLC Merger Effective Time"), each of the Common Units and Class G Units of Company LLC (each, a "Company LLC Unit") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time and after the Company LLC Units Redemptions, other than (i) the Rollover Units, (ii) the Company LLC Units owned by Parent or its wholly owned subsidiaries and (iii) the Company LLC Units owned by the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, will automatically be canceled and forfeited for no consideration.

      If the Mergers are consummated, the Class A Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the Company Merger.

     The Mergers, if entered into and consummated, would result in one or more of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, including, without limitation, the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer, a merger or other extraordinary transaction involving the Issuer, a delisting of Class A Common Stock from Nasdaq and the Class A Common Stock becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act.

     Support Agreement

     In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on December 30, 2024, the Level Rollover Stockholders, certain affiliates of Riverwood Capital Partners (collectively, "Riverwood") and certain affiliates of Silver Lake Group (collectively, "Silver Lake", together with Level Rollover Stockholders and Riverwood, the "Rollover Stockholders") entered into those certain Support Agreements (the "Support Agreements") with the Issuer, Parent and the other parties thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, the Rollover Stockholders have agreed to support the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and vote in favor of the matters to be submitted to the Issuer's stockholders in connection with the Mergers, refrain from soliciting or supporting other Acquisition Proposals and contribute, directly or indirectly, and immediately prior to the Company LLC Units Redemptions, the Class G Conversions, the Issuance and the LLC Merger Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Stock and Company LLC Units held by them (such units, the "Rollover Units") to Parent in exchange for certain equity interests of such owner of Parent, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreements and thereafter such Company Stock and Company LLC Units shall be contributed to Parent.

     The Support Agreements will terminate upon the earliest to occur of the Closing, the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and an amendment to the Merger Agreement without the prior written consent of the Rollover Stockholders that reduces the amount of the Merger Consideration or changes the form of the Merger Consideration or the written consent of the parties thereto.

     Tax Receivable Agreement and the Amendment No. 1 to Tax Receivable Agreement

     On December 6, 2021, the Issuer and the Company LLC entered into the tax receivable agreement (the "Tax Receivable Agreement") with SLP Venice Holdings, L.P., the Level Rollover Stockholders, and certain other parties thereto, which provides for the payment by Issuer to the TRA Parties (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or their transferees or assignees of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Issuer realizes (determined by using certain assumptions) in periods after the Business Combination as a result of certain events.

     In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on December 30, 2024, the Issuer and Company LLC entered into that certain Amendment No 1. to the Tax Receivable Agreement (the "TRA Amendment") with SLP Venice Holdings, L.P., Level Rollover Stockholders and the other Majority TRA Holders (as defined in the TRA Amendment), pursuant to which the Majority TRA Holders agreed to amend the Tax Receivable Agreement to provide for the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement and release the Issuer, Company LLC and the other parties thereto from any further rights or obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including with respect to the payment of all or any portion of any Early Termination Payment (as defined in the TRA Amendment) or any other amounts owed pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the TRA Amendment will be void and of no force and effect and the Tax Receivable Agreement will remain in full force and effect as if the TRA Amendment had not become effective.

     The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Tax Receivable Agreement and the TAR Amendment do not purport to be complete and are each qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements.

     Registration Rights Agreement

     On December 6, 2021, the Issuer entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Level Rollover Stockholders and certain other existing equity holders of the Issuer (collectively, the "Holders"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, following the closing of the Business Combination, the Issuer filed a registration statement permitting the offer and resale of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock held by each Holder as of the date of the Registration Rights Agreement and that they may acquire thereafter, including upon the exercise, conversion, exchange or redemption of any other security therefor which security is held by such Holder immediately following the closing of the Business Combination (the "Registrable Securities"). The Issuer will also provide certain Holders with certain customary demand registration rights, subject to the lock-up restrictions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Holders will also have "piggyback" registration rights that allow them to include their Registrable Securities in certain registrations initiated by the Issuer. Subject to customary exceptions, Holders will also have the right to request one or more underwritten offerings of Registrable Securities if the total offering price of the shares to be sold in such offering (before deduction of underwriting discounts) is reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $75 million.

     The foregoing summary of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 7 to this Schedule 13D and incorporated herein by reference.
