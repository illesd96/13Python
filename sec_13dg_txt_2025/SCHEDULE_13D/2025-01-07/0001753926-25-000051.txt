        <transactionPurpose>Dominion, through Ascent, acquired the Common Stock, as further described below, for investment purposes.

On October 16, 2024, Ascent and the Issuer entered into a securities purchase agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Issuer issued to Ascent (i) a senior secured convertible promissory note in the aggregate original principal amount of $833,333.34 (the "Note"), and (ii) 7,983 shares of Common Stock as commitment shares (the "Note Commitment Shares"). In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the subsidiaries of the Issuer (the "Subsidiaries") agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Issuer under the Note (the "Guaranty"). The Note is fully secured by collateral of the Issuer and the Subsidiaries, which security is memorialized in a security agreement (the "Security Agreement") entered into by the Issuer and Ascent, as collateral agent. The Issuer and Ascent also entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which the Issuer agreed to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note (the "Conversion Shares"). In addition, the Issuer entered into a leak-out agreement with Ascent (the "Leak-Out Agreement") pursuant to which Ascent agreed not to dispose of or otherwise transfer, in the aggregate, more than 10%of the composite daily trading volume of the Common Stock. The directors and officers agreed, also in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, to enter into lock-up Agreements (the "Lock-Up Agreements") pursuant to which each agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock of the Issuer while Ascent held either the Note or any Conversion Shares.

Pursuant to the Note, the Issuer is prohibited from effecting a conversion of any principal or interest on the Note into shares of Common Stock if those shares, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Ascent, would result in the Ascent beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the then total outstanding shares of Common Stock, however, Ascent has the ability to, upon 61 days notice, increase this beneficial ownership limitation to 9.99%.

On December 19, 2024, Ascent and the Issuer entered into an equity purchase agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Issuer may sell to Ascent, from time to time, up to $5,000,000 worth of Common Stock. As a commitment fee, the Issuer issued to Ascent (i) 17,300 shares of Common Stock (the "ELOC Commitment Shares), and (ii) a pre-funded warrant to purchase up to 21,015 shares of Common Stock (the "Pre-Funded Warrant"). Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, Ascent agreed, with respect to up to 25,283 shares (or such greater number not to exceed 4.99% of the outstanding voting power or number of shares of Common Stock), to (a) vote in favor of the transactions contemplated by that certain merger agreement, dated as of July 8, 2024, by and among the Issuer, Vyome Therapeutics, Inc. and Raider Lifesciences Inc. (the "Merger Agreement"), (b) vote against any proposals that would materially impede the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other transaction proposal, and (c) not sell or transfer any such shares of Common Stock prior to the record date of such stockholder meeting.

Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Issuer is prohibited from effecting a sale and an issuance of any Common Stock to Ascent if those shares, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Ascent, would result in the Ascent beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the then total outstanding shares of Common Stock. Similar to the Note, the Issuer is prohibited from issuing shares of Common Stock pursuant to an exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant if those shares, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Ascent, would result in the Ascent beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the then total outstanding shares of Common Stock, however, Ascent has the ability to, upon 61 days notice, increase this beneficial ownership limitation to 9.99%.

On December 27, 2024, Ascent provided notice to the Issuer (the "Notice") that it would be increasing the beneficial ownership limitation of both the Pre-Funded Warrant and Note to 9.99%. Pursuant to the Notice, effective on February 26, 2025, the Issuer shall be permitted to issue Ascent shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Note and exercise the Pre-Funded Warrant up to an aggregate maximum of 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Ascent.</transactionPurpose>
