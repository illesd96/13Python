			<transactionPurpose>The Reporting Persons acquired the Common Stock reported herein for investment purposes and not with an intent, purpose or effect of changing control of the Issuer. Although the Reporting Persons currently have no plan or proposal to acquire any additional Issuer securities or to dispose of any of the Issuer securities reported herein, the Reporting Persons may, from time to time, acquire additional equity securities or debt securities of the Issuer, which debt securities may be convertible or non-convertible, secured or unsecured, and could involve the monetization of potential revenue streams deriving from development-stage or commercial programs of the Issuer, or dispose of Issuer securities they beneficially own, on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise (including by means of 10b5-1 programs), consistent with their investment purposes and in amounts, on such terms and at such times as to be determined by the Reporting Persons based upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, their ongoing assessment of the Issuer's business prospects, the availability of Issuer securities at prices that would make the purchase or sale of such securities desirable, prevailing market conditions, the availability of other investment opportunities, and/or other considerations.

In addition, consistent with their investment purpose, the Reporting Persons may engage in communications with persons associated with the Issuer, including stockholders of the Issuer, officers of the Issuer, members of the board of directors of the Issuer, and/or or other third parties, to discuss matters regarding the Issuer, including but not limited to its operations, strategic direction, governance or capitalization, and potential business combinations or dispositions involving the Issuer or certain of its businesses.

Pursuant to the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, as described in Item 6 hereof, the Issuer is required to appoint a designee of the Fund to the Issuer's board of directors (the "Reprogrammed Appointed Director"). Erez Kalir shall initially serve as the Reprogrammed Appointed Director. Mr. Kalir will engage in regular discussions with the Issuer's board of directors and management as part of his duties as a director.

Neither Mr. Kalir (other than in his capacity as a director) nor the Reporting Persons have any present plans or proposals that relate to, or could result in, any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j), inclusive, of the instructions to Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Depending on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position, results and strategic direction, actions taken by the Issuer's management and board of directors, other investment opportunities available to Reprogrammed, the price levels of the Issuer securities, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions, the Reporting Persons may change their purpose and formulate and implement plans or proposals with respect to the Issuer at any time and from time to time. Any such action may be made by the Reporting Persons alone or in conjunction with other stockholders, potential acquirers, financing sources and/or other third parties and could include one or more purposes, plans or proposals that relate to or would result in actions required to be reported herein in accordance with Item 4 of Schedule 13D.</transactionPurpose>

			<contractDescription>DECEMBER 2024 SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Pursuant to the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, commencing on the date of the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement and ending on the date on which Reprogrammed, together with its affiliates, ceases to beneficially own at any time 4.99% or more of the then issued and outstanding Common Stock (such period, the "Reprogrammed Director Designation Right Period"), the Issuer has agreed to appoint one individual designated by Reprogrammed to its board of directors.

Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, during the Reprogrammed Director Designation Right Period, the Issuer shall invite a single representative of Reprogrammed, as designated by Reprogrammed, to attend and participate in all meetings of its board of directors, in a nonvoting observer capacity.

The foregoing description of the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of the December 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

On December 26, 2024, the Issuer entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the December 2024 PIPE Investors, pursuant to which the Issuer agreed to register for resale the Shares and the Warrant Shares held by the December 2024 PIPE Investors. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer is obligated to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") to register for resale the Shares and the Warrant Shares within 30 days of the Closing Date and to use its reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective within 75 days of the initial filing date of the Registration Statement, subject to extension under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.

The Issuer has granted the December 2024 PIPE Investors customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration statement. The December 2024 PIPE Investors have also granted the Issuer customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration statement.

The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

COMMON STOCK WARRANTS

Each Common Stock Warrant has an exercise price of $0.838 per Warrant Share. The Common Stock Warrants will be exercisable immediately and will expire seven years from the date of issuance. A holder (together with its affiliates and other attribution parties) may not exercise any portion of a Common Stock Warrant to the extent that immediately prior to or after giving effect to such exercise the holder would own more than 9.99% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock immediately after exercise, which percentage may be changed at the holder's election to any other percentage not in excess of the lower of (i) 49.99% or (ii) such percentage that, if the Common Stock Warrant was exercised to the fullest extent, would not result in a change of control under Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rule 5635(b) or any successor rule, upon 61 days' notice to the Issuer, subject to the terms of the Common Stock Warrants.

The foregoing description of the Common Stock Warrants does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Common Stock Warrant, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.4 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.</contractDescription>
