        <fundsSource>This Schedule 13D is not being filed in connection with any acquisition or disposition of equity securities of the Issuer by the Reporting Persons and, consequently, no funds were used by the Reporting Persons for such purpose.

The descriptions of the Consortium Agreement (as defined below) and the Proposal Letter (as defined below) in Item 4 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</fundsSource>
      </item3>
      <item4>
        <transactionPurpose>On January 5, 2025, the Management Members and Trustar Mobile Charging Holdings Limited ("Trustar Capital") (each, an "Initial Consortium Member" and collectively, the "Initial Consortium Members") entered into a consortium agreement (the "Consortium Agreement") pursuant to which the Initial Consortium Members agreed to (a) submit the Proposal Letter to the board of directors of the Issuer, (b) cooperate and participate in the Proposed Transaction (as defined below) in accordance with the Consortium Agreement, and (c) during the period of six (6) months after the date of the Consortium Agreement, as may be extended pursuant to the Consortium Agreement, work exclusively with each other to implement the Proposed Transaction and to conduct negotiations, prepare and finalize definitive documentation in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

On January 5, 2025, the Initial Consortium Members jointly submitted a preliminary non-binding proposal letter (the "Proposal Letter") to the board of directors of the Issuer expressing their interest in participating in a transaction to acquire all of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, including Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs, for US$0.625 in cash per Ordinary Share, or US$1.25 in cash per ADS, in each case other than those Ordinary Shares or ADSs that may be rolled over in connection with such transaction (the "Proposed Transaction").

If the Proposed Transaction is entered into and consummated, the ADSs will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and the Issuer's obligation to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act will terminate. In addition, the consummation of the Proposed Transaction could result in one or more of the actions specified in clauses (a)-(j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, including the acquisition or disposition of securities of the Issuer, a merger or other extraordinary transaction involving the Issuer, a change to the board of directors of the Issuer (as the surviving company in the merger), and a change in the Issuer's memorandum and articles of association to reflect that the Issuer would become a privately held company.

No assurance can be given that any proposal, any definitive agreement or any transaction relating to the Proposed Transaction will be entered into or consummated. The Proposal Letter provides that a binding commitment with respect to the Proposed Transaction will result only from the execution of definitive agreements and then will be on terms and conditions provided in such documentation.

The Reporting Persons reserve their right to change their plans and intentions in connection with any of the actions discussed in this Item 4. Any action taken by the Reporting Persons may be effected at any time or from time to time, subject to any applicable limitations imposed thereon by any applicable laws and the terms of the Consortium Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Consortium Agreement, the Reporting Persons may, from time to time, acquire or cause affiliates to acquire additional Ordinary Shares and/or ADSs, dispose of some or all of their Ordinary Shares and/or ADSs, engage in short-selling or hedging or similar transactions with respect to the Ordinary Shares and/or ADSs and/or continue to hold Ordinary Shares and/or ADSs.

The information disclosed in this Item 4 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Consortium Agreement and the Proposal Letter, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</transactionPurpose>

        <percentageOfClassSecurities>The responses of each of the Reporting Persons with respect to Rows 7 through 13 of the cover pages of this Schedule 13D (including but not limited to footnotes to such information) are incorporated herein by reference.

The information set forth in Items 2 and 4 is incorporated herein by reference.

As of the date hereof, in the aggregate, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own 87,225,430 Ordinary Shares, which consists of (i) 73,973,970 Class B Ordinary Shares, (ii) 11,466,460 Class A Ordinary Shares (including Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs), and (iii) 1,785,000 Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs issuable to the Reporting Persons upon the exercise of vested options within 60 days after the date hereof, which, in the aggregate, represents approximately 17.1% of the total number of Class A Ordinary Shares (assuming the conversion of the Class B Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons into Class A Ordinary Shares) and approximately 64.1% of the aggregate voting power of the Issuer. All percentages in this Item 5 are calculated based on 508,867,491 Ordinary Shares deemed to be outstanding with respect to the Reporting Persons, which consists of (i) 507,082,491 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024 based on information provided by the Issuer, and (ii) 1,785,000 Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs issuable to the Reporting Persons upon the exercise of vested options within 60 days after the date hereof.

The Reporting Persons may be deemed to be members of a "group" pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act as a result of entering into the Consortium Agreement and submitting the Proposal Letter. However, each Reporting Person expressly disclaims beneficial ownership for all purposes of the Class A Ordinary Shares (including Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs) and Class B Ordinary Shares that are beneficially owned (or deemed to be beneficially owned) by the other Reporting Persons or any other reporting person. Neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that any of the Reporting Persons beneficially owns any Class A Ordinary Shares (including Class A Ordinary Shares in the form of ADSs) or any Class B Ordinary Shares that are beneficially owned (or deemed to be beneficially owned) by the other Reporting Persons or any other reporting person. The Reporting Persons are only responsible for the information contained in this Schedule 13D and assume no responsibility for information contained in any other Schedule 13D filed by any other reporting person.</percentageOfClassSecurities>

we expect the commitments for the required equity and debt funding, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to be in place
when the definitive agreements providing for the proposed Acquisition and related transactions (the &ldquo;<U>Definitive Agreements</U>&rdquo;)
are signed. Equity financing will be provided by the Consortium Members and any additional members we may accept into the Consortium (in
each case, including by way of rollover shares and/or cash contribution). We have received highly confident letters from China Merchants
