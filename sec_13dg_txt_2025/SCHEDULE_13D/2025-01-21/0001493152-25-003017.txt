        <fundsSource>On September 14, 2022, the Issuer entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") by and among the Issuer, Forever 8 Fund LLC ("Forever 8"), the former members of Forever 8, including Mr. Vassilakos (the "Sellers"), and Mr. Vassilakos, solely in his capacity as representative of the Sellers, pursuant to which the Issuer was to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Forever 8 from the Sellers. On October 1, 2022, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement took place.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers received consideration, among other items, consisting of (i) certain non-voting preferred membership units of Forever 8, (ii) convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $27.5 million (the "Promissory Notes"), and (iii) the right to receive potential earnout amounts.  The Promissory Notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into Common Stock of the Issuer. The conversion price is initially equal to the average volume-weighted average price of the Issuer's Common Stock for the 10-trading day period immediately preceding the date of delivery of a notice of conversion, subject to a minimum price and adjustment as provided for in the Promissory Notes.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Mr. Vassilakos received Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $10,192,008.

Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Vassilakos, among other things, is entitled to a base salary payable at the annualized rate of $300,000 per year (the "Vassilakos Base Salary"). Mr. Vassilakos is also eligible for awards of restricted stock units up to 100% of the Vassilakos Base Salary, subject to the terms and conditions of the Issuer's 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), based on certain milestones to be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer's Board.

Mr. Vassilakos received an aggregate of 121,792 shares of Common Stock as a result of such issuances.

On December 12, 2024, the Issuer further amended the terms of the Promissory Notes to, among other things, provide for the conversion of approximately $1.6 million of accrued interest on the Promissory Notes into an aggregate of 485,381 shares of Common Stock.
