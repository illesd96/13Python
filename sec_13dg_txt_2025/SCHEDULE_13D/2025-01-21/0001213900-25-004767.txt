Such discussions and other actions may relate to various alternative courses of action, including, without limitation, those related to an extraordinary corporate transaction (including, but not limited to a merger, reorganization or liquidation) involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; a sale or transfer of a material portion of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries or the acquisition of material assets; the formation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances with the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; changes in the present business, operations, strategy, future plans or prospects of the Issuer, financial or governance matters; changes to the Board or management of the Issuer; changes to the capitalization, ownership structure, dividend policy, business or corporate structure or governance documents of the Issuer; de-listing or de-registration of the Issuer's securities; or any action similar to the foregoing. Such discussions and actions may be exploratory in nature, and not rise to the level of a plan or proposal.

Mr. Bess serves as Chairman of the Board and, in such capacity, may have influence over the corporate activities of the Issuer, including activities which may relate to items described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Except as described in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons do not have any present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, although, subject to the agreements described herein, the Reporting Persons, at any time and from time to time, may review, reconsider and change their position and/or change their purpose and/or develop such plans and may seek to influence management of the Issuer or the Board with respect to the business and affairs of the Issuer and may from time to time consider pursuing or proposing such matters with advisors, the Issuer or other persons.</transactionPurpose>

An additional 500,000 shares of Sponsor Stock would be owed to Bess Ventures if there was an event of default under the Bess Promissory Note. Bess Ventures is a party to the promissory note agreement, dated as of January 2, 2025 (the "2025 Bess Promissory Note", and, together with the Bess Promissory Note, the "Bess Notes"), pursuant to which the Sponsor borrowed an additional aggregate principal amount of $12,000,000 from Bess Ventures in exchange for an additional 500,000 shares of Sponsor Stock. Upon the Closing, the Sponsor Stock was converted into Common Stock.

The Sponsor Stock is subject to lock-up restrictions, including those set forth in that certain letter agreement, dated December 10, 2021, by and among BurTech, certain of its officers and directors, the Sponsor and certain other BurTech stockholders party thereto (the "2021 Letter Agreement"). Under the 2021 Letter Agreement, the Sponsor Stock cannot be transferred until the date that is 6 months after the Closing, or upon the earlier of (x) the last reported sale price of Common Stock reaching $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing and (y) the date on which the Issuer completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Issuer's stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other property (the foregoing terms, collectively, the "Letter Agreement Lock-Up Terms").

Under the Bess Notes, the Sponsor agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek release of the Sponsor Stock from the Letter Agreement Lock-Up Terms. In the event the Sponsor Stock cannot be released from the Letter Agreement Lock-Up Terms, the Sponsor agreed to transfer the Sponsor Stock to Bess Ventures following the expiration of the Letter Agreement Lock-Up Terms. As of the date hereof, the Sponsor Stock has not been released from the Letter Agreement Lock-Up Terms.

The obligations due under the Bess Promissory Note are secured by the Security Agreement, dated as of January 19, 2024 (the "Bess Security Agreement"), pursuant to which the Sponsor has granted a security interest in all of Sponsor's right, title and interest in and to the personal property and assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, set forth in Exhibit A thereto. In addition, Bess Ventures, the Sponsor and Blaize entered into a Letter Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2024 (the "Letter Agreement"), pursuant to which Blaize acknowledged and agreed to the grant of security and the obligations set forth in the Bess Security Agreement and other related loan documents, and further agreed to comply with certain instructions and procedures as set forth therein.

In addition, the obligations under the Bess Notes are guaranteed by Burkhan LLC, an affiliate of the Sponsor, under the Guaranty, Pledge and Repayment Agreement dated as of January 2, 2025 by and between Burkhan LLC and Bess Ventures (the "Guaranty Agreement").

The Sponsor defaulted on the repayment terms in connection with the Bess Promissory Note, the Bess Security Agreement and the Letter Agreement as a result of its failure to make a timely repayment of the outstanding balance that was due on March 31, 2024. On September 16, 2024, Bess Ventures and the Sponsor entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the "Forbearance Agreement"), in connection with which Bess Ventures agreed to forbear from the exercise of its remedies under the Bess Promissory Note, the Bess Security Agreement and the related loan documents until the earlier of (i) January 6, 2025 or (ii) the date that is 45 days following the Closing Date.

As of the date hereof, the beneficial ownership figures set forth in this Schedule 13D do not reflect the Sponsor Stock or any shares of Common Stock pledged for the benefit of Bess Ventures pursuant to the Second Forbearance Agreement or the 2025 Bess Security Agreement.

</FONT></B>Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Secured Party shall have the right to declare all
Obligations to be immediately due and payable and the Secured Party may exercise any and all rights and remedies hereunder or under applicable
law (including the UCC); provided, however, if any Event of Default occurs as a consequence of the commencement of a bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceeding by or against Debtor, all of the Obligations shall be automatically and immediately due and payable without further
action or demand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Secured Party shall have the right to sell or otherwise dispose
of all or any part of the Collateral, either at public or private sale, in lots or in bulk, for cash or for credit, with or without warranties
or representations, and upon such terms and conditions, all as the Secured Party, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable, and the
Secured Party shall have the right to purchase at any such sale. Debtor agrees that a notice sent at least ten days before the time of
any intended public sale or of the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made shall be reasonable
notice of such sale or other disposition. The proceeds of any such sale, or other Collateral disposition shall be applied: first, to the
expenses of retaking, holding, storing, processing and preparing for sale, selling, and the like, and to the Secured Party&rsquo;s reasonable
attorneys&rsquo; fees and legal expenses; second, to the Secured Party in satisfaction of the then unpaid Obligations; and third, to Debtor
or as otherwise required by law. If, upon the sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the proceeds thereof are insufficient to pay
all amounts to which the Secured Party are legally entitled, Debtor shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon
at the rates set forth in the Loan Agreement, and the reasonable fees of any attorneys the Secured Party employs to collect such deficiency;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to require the Secured Party to resort to or initiate proceedings
against the Collateral prior to the collection of any such deficiency from Debtor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Debtor waives

of the Secured Party&rsquo;s rights and remedies with respect thereto. &ldquo;<U>UCC</U>&rdquo; means the Uniform Commercial Code, as

such term contained in Article or Division 9 shall govern; <U>provided further</U>, that in the event that, by reason of mandatory provisions
of law, any or all of the attachment, perfection, or priority of, or remedies with respect to, the Secured Party&rsquo;s Lien on any Collateral
is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in a jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the term &ldquo;UCC&rdquo; shall
mean the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted and in effect in such other jurisdiction solely for purposes on the provisions thereof relating
to such attachment, perfection, priority, or remedies and for purposes of definitions relating to such provisions. The rights and remedies
with respect to Debtor and the Collateral, whether established hereby or by any other agreements, instruments or documents or by law,
shall be cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided under
any other agreement, instrument or document to which Debtor is a party or by which it or any of the Collateral is bound or by law or equity.</P>

Borrower confirms, acknowledges, and stipulates that all terms, conditions, and provisions of the Loan Documents are valid and enforceable

Agreement is not intended to be, and shall not be construed to constitute, a novation of any or all of the Loan Documents, nor is it intended
to create or constitute a modification of the Loan or the Loan Documents (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein) or a release
or relinquishment of, and shall not affect in any way, the liens, security interests and rights thereunder, all of which are hereby ratified,
confirmed, renewed, and extended by Borrower in all respects. Borrower reaffirms to Lender each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
and agreements of Borrower set forth in the Loan Documents, with the same force and effect as if each were separately stated herein and
made as of the date hereof and the Effective Date (subject to any changes permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents), other than&nbsp;representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements that relate to matters which by their nature can no longer be true and correct as a result of the

of the Loan Documents to which it is a party; and (ii) the provisions of the other Loan Documents shall remain unmodified and in full
force and effect except as set forth herein.</P>

and Remedies.</B> When an Event of Default occurs and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, the Lender may in its discretion
do any one or more of the following from time to time: (a) declare any Obligations immediately due and payable, whereupon they shall be
due and payable without diligence presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (but if an Event of Default described in Section 9(e) of this Agreement occurs, all
Obligations are automatically and immediately due and payable without any action by Lender) and (b) exercise any other rights and remedies
available to Lender under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (including
the right to take possession and dispose of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof). At any time during an Event of Default, Lender
is authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits at any time held and other
obligations at any time owing by the Lender to or for the credit of the account of the Borrower against the Obligations, whether or not
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
The rights of the Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of offset) that Lender
may have. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower waives and agrees not to assert any rights or privileges which it may acquire
under Section 9-626 of the UCC. Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the
Collateral are insufficient to pay the Obligations, in full and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by Lender to collect
such deficiency.</P>

and expenses), costs, and other expenses of the Lender incurred in connection with collection of the Obligations, the maintenance or preservation
of the security interest in the Collateral, the sale, disposition, or other realization on the Collateral, or the enforcement of the Lender&rsquo;s
rights hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (b) all transfer, stamp, documentary, or other similar taxes, assessments, or charges
levied by any governmental authority in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, (c) all costs, expenses, assessments,
and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording, or perfection of any Lien contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, and (d) all fees (including without limitation, all reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses), costs,
and other expenses of Lender incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of any action in any way related to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, including without limitation, any action for declaratory relief, whether incurred at the trial or appellate
level, in an arbitration proceeding or otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any insolvency proceeding
(including without limitation, any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by the Lender or any other person or entity)
relating to Borrower or any other person or entity; provided, that unless an Event of Default occurs, such legal fees shall be capped
at $20,000 (Twenty Thousand US Dollars).</P>

occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Secured Party shall have the right to declare all Obligations to
be immediately due and payable and the Secured Party may exercise any and all rights and remedies hereunder or under applicable law
(including the UCC); provided, however, if any Event of Default occurs as a consequence of the commencement of a bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceeding by or against Debtor, all of the Obligations shall be automatically and immediately due and payable without
further action or demand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Secured Party shall have the right to sell or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral, either at public or private sale, in lots or in bulk, for cash or for
credit, with or without warranties or representations, and upon such terms and conditions, all as the Secured Party, in its sole
discretion, may deem advisable, and the Secured Party shall have the right to purchase at any such sale. Debtor agrees that a notice
sent at least ten days before the time of any intended public sale or of the time after which any private sale or other disposition
of the Collateral is to be made shall be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition. The proceeds of any such sale, or
other Collateral disposition shall be applied: first, to the expenses of retaking, holding, storing, processing and preparing for
sale, selling, and the like, and to the Secured Party&rsquo;s reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and legal expenses; second, to the
Secured Party in satisfaction of the then unpaid Obligations; and third, to Debtor or as otherwise required by law. If, upon the
sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the proceeds thereof are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Secured Party are
legally entitled, Debtor shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the rates set forth in the Loan
Agreement, and the reasonable fees of any attorneys the Secured Party employs to collect such deficiency; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that the foregoing shall not be deemed to require the Secured Party to resort to or initiate proceedings against the Collateral
prior to the collection of any such deficiency from Debtor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Debtor waives all claims,
damages and demands against the Secured Party arising out of the retention or sale or lease of the Collateral or other exercise of
the Secured Party&rsquo;s rights and remedies with respect thereto. &ldquo;<U>UCC</U>&rdquo; means the Uniform Commercial Code, as

&ldquo;UCC&rdquo; is used to define any term herein and such term is defined differently in different Articles or Divisions of the
UCC, the definition of such term contained in Article or Division 9 shall govern; <U>provided further</U>, that in the event that,
by reason of mandatory provisions of law, any or all of the attachment, perfection, or priority of, or remedies with respect to, the
Secured Party&rsquo;s Lien on any Collateral is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in a jurisdiction other than the
State of New York, the term &ldquo;UCC&rdquo; shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted and in effect in such other
jurisdiction solely for purposes on the provisions thereof relating to such attachment, perfection, priority, or remedies and for
purposes of definitions relating to such provisions. The rights and remedies with respect to Debtor and the Collateral, whether
established hereby or by any other agreements, instruments or documents or by law, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singly
or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided under any other agreement, instrument or document to
which Debtor is a party or by which it or any of the Collateral is bound or by law or equity.</P>

to be immediately due and payable and the Secured Party may exercise any and all rights and remedies hereunder or under applicable law
(including the UCC); provided, however, if any Event of Default occurs as a consequence of the commencement of a bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceeding by or against Debtor, all of the Secured Obligations shall be automatically and immediately due and payable without further
action or demand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Secured Party shall have the right to sell or otherwise dispose
of all or any part of the Collateral, either at public or private sale, in lots or in bulk, for cash or for credit, with or without warranties
or representations, and upon such terms and conditions, all as the Secured Party, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable, and the
Secured Party shall have the right to purchase at any such sale. Debtor agrees that a notice sent at least ten days before the time of
any intended public sale or of the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made shall be reasonable
notice of such sale or other disposition. The proceeds of any such sale, or other Collateral disposition shall be applied: first, to the
expenses of retaking, holding, storing, processing and preparing for sale, selling, and the like, and to the Secured Party&rsquo;s reasonable
attorneys&rsquo; fees and legal expenses; second, to the Secured Party in satisfaction of the then unpaid Secured Obligations; and third,
to Debtor or as otherwise required by law. If, upon the sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the proceeds thereof are insufficient
to pay all amounts to which the Secured Party are legally entitled, Debtor shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest
thereon at the rates set forth in the Loan Agreement, and the reasonable fees of any attorneys the Secured Party employs to collect such
deficiency; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to require the Secured Party to resort to or initiate
proceedings against the Collateral prior to the collection of any such deficiency from Debtor. To the extent permitted by applicable law,

or other exercise of the Secured Party&rsquo;s rights and remedies with respect thereto. &ldquo;<U>UCC</U>&rdquo; means the Uniform Commercial

the &ldquo;UCC&rdquo; is used to define any term herein and such term is defined differently in different Articles or Divisions of the
UCC, the definition of such term contained in Article or Division 9 shall govern; <U>provided further</U>, that in the event that, by
reason of mandatory provisions of law, any or all of the attachment, perfection, or priority of, or remedies with respect to, the Secured
Party&rsquo;s Lien on any Collateral is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in a jurisdiction other than the State of New
York, the term &ldquo;UCC&rdquo; shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted and in effect in such other jurisdiction solely for
purposes on the provisions thereof relating to such attachment, perfection, priority, or remedies and for purposes of definitions relating
to such provisions. The rights and remedies with respect to Debtor and the Collateral, whether established hereby or by any other agreements,

Agreement is not intended to be, and shall not be construed to constitute, a novation of any or all of the Loan Documents, nor is it intended
