        <contractDescription>Private Placement Shares Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and Sponsor

On January 8, 2025, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsor purchased 500,000 Placement Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Placement Shares are subject to a lock up provision in the Purchase Agreement, which provides that such Placement Shares shall not be transferable, saleable or assignable until 30 days after the consummation of the Issuer's initial business combination, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in the Insider Letter (as defined below).

The description of the Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.5 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.A).

Insider Letter

On January 6, 2025, in connection with the IPO, the Issuer, the Sponsor and certain other parties thereto entered into a letter agreement (the "Insider Letter"). Pursuant to the Insider Letter, the Sponsor agreed (A) to vote its Ordinary Shares in favor of any proposed initial business combination (except that any Class A Ordinary Shares that were sold in the IPO ("public shares") it may purchase in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act would not be voted in favor of approving the initial business combination), (B) not to propose an amendment to the Issuer's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would modify the substance or delay the timing of the Issuer's obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Issuer's initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Issuer does not consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the completion of the IPO (or (i) such earlier period approved by the board of directors of the Issuer or (ii) such later period approved by the Issuer's shareholders) unless the Issuer provides the holders of public shares with the opportunity to redeem such public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Issuer's trust account set up in connection with the IPO (the "Trust Account"), (C) not to redeem any Class B Ordinary Shares and Placement Shares into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the Issuer's proposed initial business combination, and (D) that the Class B Ordinary Shares and Placement Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if an initial business combination is not consummated. The Sponsor also agreed that in the event of the liquidation of the Trust Account, it will indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer against any and all loss, liability, claims, damage and expense whatsoever which the Issuer may become subject to as a result of any claim by any vendor or other person who is owed money by the Issuer for services rendered or products sold to or contracted for the Issuer, or by any target business with which the Issuer has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense does not reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account; provided that such indemnity shall not apply if such vendor or prospective target business executes an agreement waiving any claims against the Trust Account.

The description of the Insider Letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.1 to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.B).

Registration Rights Agreement

On January 6, 2025, in connection with the IPO, the Issuer and the Sponsor entered into a registration rights agreement with the Issuer, pursuant to which the Sponsor was granted certain demand and "piggyback" registration rights, which will be subject to customary conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters of an offering to limit the number of shares offered. The summary of such registration rights agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.3 to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.C).

Expense Advance Agreement and Related Promissory Note

On January 6, 2025, in connection with the IPO, the Issuer and the Sponsor entered into an expense advance agreement, pursuant to which the Sponsor has committed to provide up to $1,750,000 to the Issuer to fund the Issuer's expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements prior to the Issuer's initial business combination. The summary of such expense advance agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.4 to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.D).

As contemplated by the Expense Advance Agreement, on January 6, 2025, the Issuer issued a promissory note to the Sponsor. The principal amount of the note is $1,750,000 and the note is interest free. The note is payable upon the Issuer's initial business combination; provided that such note will be convertible at the Sponsor's option into Class A Ordinary Shares at a conversion price of $10.00 per share no earlier than 60 days after the date of the IPO. The summary of such promissory note contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.6 to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.E).

Sponsor Note

On January 6, 2025, in connection with the IPO, the Issuer issued to the Sponsor a promissory note in the amount of up to $3,000,000. The Sponsor agreed to lend to the Issuer up to $3,000,000 under this promissory note, which will be drawn by the Issuer in connection with the consummation of its initial business combination, an extension of time for the Issuer to consummate an initial business combination or its liquidation (each, a "Redemption Event"), such that an amount equal to $0.15 per public share being redeemed in connection with the applicable Redemption Event will be added to the Trust Account and paid to the holders of the applicable redeemed shares on such Redemption Event. Upon consummation of the Issuer's initial business combination, the outstanding amounts under the promissory note will be repaid by the Issuer; provided that such note will be convertible at the Sponsor's option into Class A Ordinary Shares at a conversion price of $10.00 per share no earlier than 60 days after the date of the IPO. If the Issuer is unable to consummate an initial business combination, the outstanding amounts under the promissory note would be repaid only out of funds held outside of the Trust Account. The summary of such promissory note contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Issuer as Exhibit 10.8 to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the SEC on January 10, 2025 (and is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 99.F).</contractDescription>
