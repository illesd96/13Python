Securities Purchase Agreement

On January 24, 2025, the Issuer entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement, relating to the issuance and sale to KCP of 6,363,636 shares of Common Stock and one Warrant to purchase 6,363,636 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $14 million. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Issuer increased the size of the Board as of the Closing Date in order to appoint an individual designated by KCP (the "Designee"). Roger C. Kennedy is the Designee and was appointed to the Board effective as of the Closing Date. At any annual or special meeting of the Issuer's stockholders at which the term of the Designee will expire, KCP will have the right to nominate a candidate for election to the Board at such meeting or action by written consent, and the Issuer must include such candidate in the Issuer's slate of nominees and support such candidate in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the Issuer supports its other nominees. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Reporting Persons have agreed that they may not transfer or sell the shares of Common Stock or Warrant for six months immediately following closing of the transaction contemplated thereunder.

Warrant

On January 24, 2025, the Issuer issued the Warrant to KCP. Under the Warrant, the Issuer granted KCP a Warrant exercisable into 6,363,636 shares of Common Stock. The Warrant is exercisable six months after issuance at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and will remain exercisable for five years following issuance.

Registration Rights Agreement

On the Closing Date, the Issuer entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with KCP pursuant to which KCP and its affiliates will have certain customary registration rights with respect to shares of Common Stock held by KCP and its affiliates and permitted transferees, including any Common Stock issued upon any future exercise of the Warrants, pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement.

The foregoing description of the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of such documents, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Schedule 13D and are incorporated herein by reference.</contractDescription>
