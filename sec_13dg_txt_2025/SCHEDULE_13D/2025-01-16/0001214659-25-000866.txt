        <transactionPurpose>The Reporting Person acquired the shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Person for investment purposes. The Reporting Person intends to review and evaluate his investment in the Issuer on an ongoing basis taking into consideration such factors as the Reporting Person deems relevant, including without limitation the business and prospects of the Issuer, other developments concerning the Issuer, trading prices of the Issuer's securities, existing or anticipated market or economic conditions (in general or related to the Issuer or the industry in which it operates) and other opportunities available to the Reporting Person. Based on such review and evaluation or other factors, the Reporting Person may (i) acquire or seek to acquire additional securities of the Issuer, including shares of Common Stock or (ii) sell or dispose or seek to sell or dispose of securities of the Issuer currently held by the Reporting Person or acquired by the Reporting Person in the future, in each case, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions (which may be with the Issuer or with third parties) or otherwise. Additionally, the Reporting Person expects to engage in communications with management and other members of the board of directors of the Issuer, other holders of securities of the Issuer and potentially other persons regarding a variety of matters related to the Issuer, its business, strategy, assets or securities. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Reporting Person may from time to time review, evaluate and explore, and engage in communications with such other persons regarding, strategic alternatives for the Issuer, including a merger or other business combination or take-private transaction involving the Issuer, the acquisition or disposition of securities of the Issuer or other extraordinary corporate transactions involving the Issuer. Any such review, evaluation, exploration or communication engaged in by the Reporting Person could lead to the development by the Reporting Person of, or the participation by the Reporting Person in, a plan or proposal that relates to or could result in one or more of the actions or events specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, or such activities could be preliminary only and not lead to any such plan or proposal. The Reporting Person may change his intentions with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this Item 4.</transactionPurpose>
