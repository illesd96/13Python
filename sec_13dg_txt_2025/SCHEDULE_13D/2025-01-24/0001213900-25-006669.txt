<B>Investment Representations</B>. Each Buyer represents and warrants, with respect to himself or herself only, as set forth herein.
Such Buyer hereby acknowledges that an investment in the Initial Shares involves certain significant risks. Such Buyer has no need for
liquidity in its investment in the Initial Shares for the foreseeable future and is able to bear the risk of that investment for an indefinite
period. Such Buyer acknowledges and hereby agrees that the Initial Shares will not be transferable under any circumstances unless registered
by the Company in accordance with federal and state securities laws or sold in compliance with an exemption under such laws and such
transfer complies with all applicable lock-up restrictions on such Buyer (as described in the Company&rsquo;s registration statement
on Form&nbsp;S-1, as may be amended (the &ldquo;<U>Registration Statement</U>&rdquo;), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&ldquo;<U>Act</U>&rdquo;), relating to a contemplated underwritten public offering by the Company (the &ldquo;<U>Public Offering</U>&rdquo;)).
Such Buyer further understands and agrees that Buyer will be required to execute and deliver a letter agreement including, among other
provisions, the foregoing transfer restrictions as described in the Registration Statement, and that any certificates evidencing the
Initial Shares bear a legend referring to such transfer restrictions.</FONT></P>

into any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement for such resale, distribution, subdivision or fractionalization. Such Buyer
has been given the opportunity to (i)&nbsp;ask questions of and receive answers from the Seller and the Company concerning the terms
and conditions of the Initial Shares, and the business and financial condition of the Company and (ii)&nbsp;obtain any additional information
that the Seller possess or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to assist such Buyer in evaluating the
advisability of the purchase of the Initial Shares and an investment in the Company. Such Buyer is not relying on any oral representation
made by any person as to the Company or its operations, financial condition or prospects. Such Buyer is an &ldquo;accredited investor&rdquo;
as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act. In the event such Buyer does not join
the Board of Directors of the Company upon the consummation of the Public Offering (whether and either at the election of the Company
or such Buyer for any reason), then the Buyer shall promptly return the Initial Shares to the Company.</FONT></P>
