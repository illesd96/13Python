        <filingPersonName>This statement is being filed by Karpus Management, Inc., d/b/a Karpus Investment Management ("Karpus" or the "Reporting Person"). Karpus is a registered investment adviser under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Karpus is controlled by City of London Investment Group plc ("CLIG"), which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. However, in accordance with SEC Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998), effective informational barriers have been established between Karpus and CLIG such that voting and investment power over the subject securities is exercised by Karpus independently of CLIG, and, accordingly, attribution of beneficial ownership is not required between Karpus and CLIG.

The Shares to which this Schedule 13G relates are owned directly by the accounts managed by Karpus.</filingPersonName>
