of FMR LLC.

Members of the Johnson family, including Abigail P. Johnson, are the
predominant owners, directly or through trusts, of Series B voting common
shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting power of FMR LLC. The

shares. Accordingly, through their ownership of voting common shares and the

group with respect to FMR LLC.

This filing reflects the securities beneficially owned, or that may be deemed
to be beneficially owned, by FMR LLC, certain of its subsidiaries and
affiliates, and other companies (collectively, the "FMR Reporters"). This
filing does not reflect securities, if any, beneficially owned by certain

Commission Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998).
