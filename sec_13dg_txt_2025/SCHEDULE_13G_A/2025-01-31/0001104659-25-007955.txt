the terms of the 1997 Voting Trust, in the event Timothy P. Horne ceases to serve as trustee of the 1997 Voting Trust, then Joseph T.
Noonan and Walter J. Flowers (each, a &ldquo;Successor Trustee&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;Successor Trustees&rdquo;), shall thereupon
become co-trustees of the 1997 Voting Trust if such individuals are willing and able to succeed. At any time, Timothy P. Horne, if then
living and not subject to incapacity, may designate up to two additional persons, one to be designated as the primary designee (the &ldquo;Primary
Designee&rdquo;) and the other as the secondary designee (&ldquo;Secondary Designee&rdquo;), to serve in the stead of any Successor Trustee
who shall be unable or unwilling to serve as a trustee of the 1997 Voting Trust. Such designations are revocable by Timothy P. Horne at
any time prior to the time at which such designees become a trustee. </FONT>If any of the Successor Trustees is unable or unwilling or
shall otherwise fail to serve as a trustee of the 1997 Voting Trust, or after becoming a co-trustee shall cease to serve as such for any
reason, then a third person shall become a co-trustee with the remaining two trustees, in accordance with the following line of succession:
first, any individual designated as the Primary Designee, next, any individual designated as the Secondary Designee, and then, an individual
appointed by the holders of a majority in interest of the voting trust certificates then outstanding. In the event that the Successor
Trustees shall not concur on matters not specifically contemplated by the terms of the 1997 Voting Trust, the vote of a majority of the
Successor Trustees shall be determinative. No trustee or Successor Trustee shall possess the Determination Power unless it is specifically
conferred upon such trustee pursuant to the provisions of the 1997 Voting Trust.</P>
