The ESOP holds an aggregate of 597,127 shares of the Company's Common Stock (21% of the outstanding shares).  The ESOP has the sole voting power with respect to shares held by it which have not been allocated to participant accounts, and shared voting power with respect to shares held by it which have been allocated to participant accounts.

Pursuant to the ESOP, participants are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the voting of shares allocated to their accounts unless the Trustee determines that the instructions would be a violation of ERISA.  Subject to ERISA, the Trustee votes the unallocated shares in the manner directed by the Board of Directors of the Company, which is currently in the same proportion as the instructions received on the allocated shares.

Jennifer Pickering was appointed ESOP Trustee effective July 1, 2024, and was sole trustee as of December 31, 2024.   Jennifer Pickering disclaims beneficial ownership of all of the shares held by the ESOP, as she currently does not have any shares allocated to her under the plan.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
