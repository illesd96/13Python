        <filingPersonName>This statement is filed by the entities and persons listed below, who are collectively referred to herein as "Reporting Persons," with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible notes (the "Notes") and Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants (the "Warrants") of Greenlane Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"):

(i)  Empery Asset Management, LP (the "Investment Manager"), with respect to the Common Stock held by, and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants held by, funds to which the Investment Manager serves as investment manager (the "Empery Funds");

(ii)  Mr. Ryan M. Lane ("Mr. Lane"), with respect to the Common Stock held by, and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants held by, the Empery Funds; and

(iii)  Mr. Martin D. Hoe ("Mr. Hoe"), with respect to the Common Stock held by, and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants held by, the Empery Funds.

The Investment Manager serves as the investment manager to each of the Empery Funds. Each of Mr. Lane and Mr. Hoe (the "Reporting Individuals") is a Managing Member of Empery AM GP, LLC (the "General Partner"), the general partner of the Investment Manager.</filingPersonName>
        <principalBusinessOfficeOrResidenceAddress>The address of the business office of each of the Reporting Persons is:

        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>The information required by Item 4(a) is set forth in Row 9 of the cover page for each of the Reporting Persons and is incorporated herein by reference.

The percentage set forth in this Schedule 13G/A is calculated based upon an aggregate of 2,132,124 shares of Common Stock, which is the sum of (i) 1,982,124 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of November 25, 2024, as reported in the Company's Amendment No. 2 to the Definitive Proxy Statement on Form 14A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 27, 2024 and (ii) 150,000 shares of Common Stock subsequently issued by the Company to the Empery Funds upon prior exercises of warrants of the Company after November 25, 2024 and prior to December 31, 2024, and assumes the conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants, each subject to the Blockers (as defined below).

Pursuant to the terms of the Notes and the Warrants, the Reporting Persons cannot convert the Notes or exercise the Warrants to the extent the Reporting Persons would beneficially own, after any such conversion or exercise, more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Blockers"), and the shares of Common Stock listed as beneficially owned in Rows 6, 8 and 9 of the cover page for each Reporting Person and the percentage set forth in Row 11 of the cover page for each Reporting Person give effect to the Blockers.  Consequently, as of the date of the event which requires the filing of this statement, the Reporting Persons were not able to convert all of the Notes or exercise all of the Warrants due to the Blockers.

The Investment Manager, which serves as the investment manager to the Empery Funds, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all shares of Common Stock held by, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants (each subject to the Blockers) held by, the Empery Funds.  Each of the Reporting Individuals, as Managing Members of the General Partner of the Investment Manager with the power to exercise investment discretion, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all of the shares of Common Stock held by, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants (each subject to the Blockers) held by, the Empery Funds.  The foregoing should not be construed in and of itself as an admission by any Reporting Person as to beneficial ownership of all shares of Common Stock owned by another Reporting Person.  Each of the Empery Funds and the Reporting Individuals hereby disclaims any beneficial ownership of any such shares of Common Stock.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
