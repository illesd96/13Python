By: /s/JAMES F. CLARK
Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer of Putnam Global Health Care Fund


Exhibit B: Item 4 Ownership
     The securities reported herein are beneficially owned by one or more open or closed end investment companies or other managed accounts that are investment management clients of investment managers that are direct and indirect subsidiaries (each, an "Investment Management Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Investment Management Subsidiaries") of Franklin Resources Inc. ("FRI"), including the Investment Management Subsidiaries listed in this Item 4.  When an investment management contract (including a sub advisory agreement) delegates to an Investment Management Subsidiary investment discretion or voting power over the securities held in the investment advisory accounts that are subject to that agreement, FRI treats the Investment Management Subsidiary as having sole investment discretion or voting authority, as the case may be, unless the agreement specifies otherwise. Accordingly, each Investment Management Subsidiary reports on Schedule 13G that it has sole investment discretion and voting authority over the securities covered by any such investment management agreement, unless otherwise noted in this Item 4.  As a result, for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Act, the Investment Management Subsidiaries listed in this Item 4 may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of the securities reported in this Schedule 13G.
     Beneficial ownership by Investment Management Subsidiaries and other FRI affiliates is being reported in conformity with the guidelines articulated by the SEC staff in Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998) (the "1998 Release") relating to organizations, such as FRI, where related entities exercise voting and investment powers over the securities being reported independently from each other. The voting and investment powers held by each of FRI's affiliates whose ownership of securities is disaggregated from that of FRI in accordance with the 1998 Release ("FRI Disaggregated Affiliates") are exercised independently from FRI and from all other Investment Management Subsidiaries (FRI, its affiliates and the Investment Management Subsidiaries other than FRI Disaggregated Affiliates are collectively, "FRI Aggregated Affiliates"). Furthermore, internal policies and procedures of, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates, and, on the other hand, FRI establish informational barriers that prevent the flow among, on the one hand, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates (including preventing the flow between such entities), and, on the other hand, the FRI Aggregated Affiliates of information that relates to the voting and investment powers over the securities owned by their respective investment management clients. Consequently, FRI Disaggregated Affiliates report the securities over which they hold investment and voting power separately from the FRI Aggregated Affiliates for purposes of Section 13 of the Act.
     Charles B. Johnson and Rupert H. Johnson, Jr. (the "Principal Shareholders") may each own in excess of 10% of the outstanding common stock of FRI and are the principal stockholders of FRI (see FRI's Proxy Statement-Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners). FRI and the Principal Shareholders may be deemed to be, for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Act, the beneficial owners of securities held by persons and entities for whom or for which FRI subsidiaries provide investment management services.  The number of shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned and the percentage of the class of  which such shares are a part are reported in Items 9 and 11 of the cover page for FRI. FRI, the Principal Shareholders and each of the Investment Management Subsidiaries disclaim any pecuniary interest in any of such securities. In addition, the filing of this Schedule 13G on behalf of the Principal Shareholders, FRI and the FRI Aggregated Affiliates, as applicable, should not be construed as an admission that any of them is, and each of them disclaims that it is, the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3, of any of the securities reported in this Schedule 13G.
     FRI, the Principal Shareholders, and each of the Investment Management Subsidiaries believe that they are not a "group" within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Act and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the beneficial ownership of the securities held by any of them or by any persons or entities for whom or for which the Investment Management Subsidiaries provide investment management services.
