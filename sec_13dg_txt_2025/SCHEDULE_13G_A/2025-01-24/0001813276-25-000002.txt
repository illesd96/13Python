        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>723,940 common shares

1. This number includes:

a. 68,203 outstanding common shares, and
b. 655,737 common shares that the reporting person has a right to acquire upon conversion of US$20 million principal amount of the issuer's five-year, 9% unsecured convertible debentures (the "Debentures"). Rule 13d-3(d)(1) provides that securities are deemed to be beneficially owned if one has a right to acquire beneficial ownership of those securities within 60 days, including through the conversion of a security. The Debentures are convertible at a price of US$30.50 per common share, and thus the reporting person has the right to acquire 655,737 common shares upon conversion of the Debentures.

2. This number does not include the common shares that will be issuable to the reporting person in the future in partial payment of interest on the Debentures. Interest is payable on the Debentures in quarterly installments in arrears on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year. A portion of the interest (equal to 2% per annum) will be payable in common shares issuable at a price equal to the 20-day volume weighted average trading price (the "VWAP") of the common shares on the exchange on which the common shares are trading that has the greatest trading volume, ending three trading days preceding the date such interest payment is due.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
