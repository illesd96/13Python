The foregoing excludes (I) 40,195 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1 because Intracoastal Warrant 1 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 1 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 9.99% of the Common Stock and (II) 353,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA ("Intracoastal Warrant 2") because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock. Without such blocker provisions, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 890,000 shares of Common Stock.

(ii)  As of the close of business on January 16, 2025, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 504,478 shares of Common Stock, which consisted of (i) 320,478 shares of Common Stock held by Intracoastal and (ii) 184,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1, and all such shares of Common Stock represented beneficial ownership of approximately 6.9% of the Common Stock, based on (1) 4,476,220 shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SPA, as reported to the Reporting Persons by the Issuer, plus (2) 2,611,600 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate issued at the closing of transaction contemplated by the SPA and (3) 184,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1. The foregoing excludes 353,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2 because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock. Without such blocker provision, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 857,478 shares of Common Stock.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
