        <filingPersonName>This statement is filed by the entities and persons listed below, who are collectively referred to herein as "Reporting Persons," with respect to Ordinary Shares, par value $0.06 per share (the "Ordinary Shares") and Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of warrants (the "Warrants") of BTC Digital Ltd., an exempted Cayman Islands company (the "Company"):

(i) Empery Asset Management, LP (the "Investment Manager"), with respect to the Ordinary Shares held by, and the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants held by, funds to which the Investment Manager serves as investment manager (the "Empery Funds");

(ii) Mr. Ryan M. Lane ("Mr. Lane"), with respect to the Ordinary Shares held by, and the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants held by, the Empery Funds; and

(iii) Mr. Martin D. Hoe ("Mr. Hoe"), with respect to the Ordinary Shares held by, and the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants held by, the Empery Funds.

The Investment Manager serves as the investment manager to each of the Empery Funds. Each of Mr. Lane and Mr. Hoe (the "Reporting Individuals") is a Managing Member of Empery AM GP, LLC (the "General Partner"), the general partner of the Investment Manager.</filingPersonName>
        <principalBusinessOfficeOrResidenceAddress>The address of the business office of each of the Reporting Persons is:

1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1205  New York, New York 10020</principalBusinessOfficeOrResidenceAddress>

      <item4>
        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>The information required by Item 4(a) is set forth in Row 9 of the cover page for each of the Reporting Persons and is incorporated herein by reference.

The percentage set forth in this Schedule 13G is calculated based upon an aggregate of 5,025,249 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 9, 2024, as reported in the Company's Prospectus Supplement on Form 424(b)(5), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 9, 2024, and assumes exercise of the Warrants (subject to the Blocker (as defined below)).

Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, the Reporting Persons cannot exercise the Warrants to the extent the Reporting Persons would beneficially own, after any such exercise, more than 9.99% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (the "Blocker"), and the Ordinary Shares listed as beneficially owned in Rows 6, 8 and 9 of the cover page for each Reporting Person and the percentage set forth in Row 11 of the cover page for each Reporting Person give effect to the Blockers.  Consequently, as of the date of the event which requires the filing of this statement, the Reporting Persons were not able to exercise all of the Warrants due to the Blocker.

The Investment Manager, which serves as the investment manager to the Empery Funds, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all of the Ordinary Shares held by, and the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (subject to the Blocker) held by, the Empery Funds.  Each of the Reporting Individuals, as Managing Members of the General Partner of the Investment Manager with the power to exercise investment discretion, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all of the Ordinary Shares held by, and the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (subject to the Blocker) held by, by the Empery Funds.  The foregoing should not be construed in and of itself as an admission by any Reporting Person as to beneficial ownership of the Ordinary Shares owned by another Reporting Person.  Each of the Empery Funds and the Reporting Individuals hereby disclaims any beneficial ownership of any such Ordinary Shares.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
