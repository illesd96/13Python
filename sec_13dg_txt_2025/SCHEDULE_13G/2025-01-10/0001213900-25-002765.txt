Without such blocker provisions, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 375,000,000 Ordinary Shares.

(ii)  As of the close of business on January 10, 2025, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 102,236,115 Ordinary Shares, which consisted of (i) 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares held by Intracoastal and (ii) 27,236,115 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2, and all such Ordinary Shares represented beneficial ownership of approximately 4.99% of the Ordinary Shares, based on (1) 1,482,601,995 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of January 6, 2025, as reported by the Issuer, plus (2) 514,981,830 Ordinary Shares in the aggregate issued at the closing of transaction contemplated by the SPA, (3) 24,000,000 Ordinary Shares issued to Intracoastal upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1 and (4) 27,236,115 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2. The foregoing excludes 160,263,885 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2 because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Ordinary Shares. Without such blocker provision, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 262,500,000 Ordinary Shares.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
