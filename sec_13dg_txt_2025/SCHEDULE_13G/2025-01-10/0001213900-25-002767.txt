The foregoing excludes (I) 2,514,286 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA ("Intracoastal Warrant 1") because Intracoastal Warrant 1 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 1 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock, (II) 221,062 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant held by Intracoastal ("Intracoastal Warrant 2") because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock and (III) 783,336 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a second warrant held by Intracoastal ("Intracoastal Warrant 3") because Intracoastal Warrant 3 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 3 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock. Without such blocker provisions, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 4,775,827 shares of Common Stock.
