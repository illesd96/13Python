        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>The information required by this item with respect to the Reporting Person is set forth in Rows 5 through 9 and 11 of the cover page to this Schedule 13G. The ownership percentages reported are based on 268,778,808 outstanding shares of voting Common Stock after giving effect to the full conversion of the Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock") (without regard to beneficial ownership limitations that may limit the ability of certain holders of Preferred Stock to convert such shares to Common Stock), as reported in the Issuer's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 6, 2025.

Durable Capital Master Fund LP directly holds 26,609,101 shares of Common Stock, including shares currently able to be acquired upon conversion of shares of the Preferred Stock (the "Shares"). Additionally, Durable Capital Master Fund LP holds additional shares of Preferred Stock that is not currently convertible due to the Certificate of Designation governing the Preferred Stock, which prevents conversion to the extent that Durable Capital Master Fund LP would beneficially own more than 9.9% of the Common Stock immediately after giving effect to such conversion. The Reporting Person, as the investment adviser to Durable Capital Master Fund LP, has sole power to direct the vote and disposition of the Shares. Durable Capital Partners GP LLC ("Durable GP") is the general partner of the Reporting Person, and Henry Ellenbogen is the chief investment officer of the Reporting Person and the managing member of Durable GP.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
