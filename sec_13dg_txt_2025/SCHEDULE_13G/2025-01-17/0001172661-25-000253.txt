    <exhibitInfo>Item 4: Information with respect to the Reporting Persons' ownership of the Common Stock as of January 17, 2025, is incorporated by reference to items (5) - (9) and (11) of the cover page of the respective Reporting Person.

The amount beneficially owned by each Reporting Person is determined using 92,838,737 shares, calculated using 92,423,796 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of January 10, 2025, according to the issuer's Prospectus filed with the SEC on January 10, 2025, and 414,941 Ordinary Shares that would be converted to Ordinary Shares by the Reporting Person up to the Maximum Percentage.

The beneficially owned shares include 8,700,000 Pre-Funded Warrants and 17,559,648 Warrants exercisable to common shares, subject to a 9.99% Maximum Percentage exercise limitation. The Issuer shall not effect the exercise of any portion of the Pre-Funded Warrants and Warrants, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the holder collectively would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the "Maximum Percentage") of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
