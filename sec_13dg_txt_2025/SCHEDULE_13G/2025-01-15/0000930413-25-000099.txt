        <filingPersonName>BDC Capital Inc. ("BDC") is a subsidiary of the Business Development Bank of Canada which is a
Crown corporation whose sole shareholder is the Government of Canada.

This constitutes a late filing due to inadvertent administrative error. The securities of D-Wave
Quantum Inc. (the "Company") covered by this Schedule 13G were acquired prior to the registration of that class in July 2022. The Reporting Person's ownership of the issuer's securities has been appropriately reported in the issuer's initial registration statement on Form S-4.

The Reporting Person did not file an initial report Schedule 13G to report its 8.45% beneficial
ownership as of December 31, 2022. Such percentage is based on the Company's most recent
reported number of shares outstanding at the relevant time. All of the shares reported herein were
sold between November 25, 2024 and December 2, 2024 and therefore all of the shares reported
herein have been disposed of as of the date of this filing. Immediately prior to the sale of the shares reported herein, the Reporting Person's beneficial ownership of the issuer's securities was 4.2% with such dilution due to issuer action. Such percentage is based on the Company's most recent reported number of shares outstanding at the relevant time.</filingPersonName>

        <classPercent>Calculation of percentage of beneficial ownership as of December 31, 2022 is based on (i) 63,096,354 shares of common stock at par value $0.0001 and (ii) 48,409,641 exchangeable shares outstanding, which are convertible into shares of common stock on a one for one basis at any time for no consideration, as reported by D-Wave Quantum Inc. in its Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on November 10, 2022.

Calculation of percentage of beneficial ownership as of November 25, 2024 is based on (i) 180,252,641 shares of common stock at par value $0.0001 and (ii) 43,762,188 exchangeable shares outstanding, which are convertible into shares of common stock on a one for one basis at any time for no consideration, as reported by D-Wave Quantum Inc. in its Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on November 14, 2024.
