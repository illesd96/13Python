        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>(i) Immediately following the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement with the Issuer on December 27, 2024 (the "SPA") (as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 30, 2024), each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 217,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA, and all such shares of Common Stock represent beneficial ownership of approximately 9.9% of the Common Stock, based on (1) 1,976,999 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 27, 2024, as reported to by the Issuer, plus (2) 217,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA. The foregoing excludes (I) 217,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA ("Intracoastal Warrant 1") because Intracoastal Warrant 1 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 1 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock, (II) 741 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant held by Intracoastal ("Intracoastal Warrant 2") because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock and (III) 855 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a second warrant held by Intracoastal ("Intracoastal Warrant 3") because Intracoastal Warrant 3 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 3 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock. Without such blocker provisions, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 435,596 shares of Common Stock.

(ii) As of the close of business on January 3, 2025, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 165,293 shares of Common Stock, which consisted of (i) 29,800 shares of Common Stock held by Intracoastal and (ii) 135,493 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1, and all such shares of Common Stock represented beneficial ownership of approximately 4.99% of the Common Stock, based on (1) 1,976,999 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 27, 2024, as reported to by the Issuer, plus (2) 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate issued at the closing of transaction contemplated by the SPA and (3) 135,493 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1. The foregoing excludes (I) 81,507 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1 because Intracoastal Warrant 1 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 1 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock, (II) 741 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2 because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock and (III) 855 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 3 because Intracoastal Warrant 3 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 3 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Common Stock.
