On December 31, 2024, the Issuer entered into an exclusive agreement (the "Licensing Agreement") with AstralBio, Inc. ("AstralBio"), as disclosed in the Issuer's current report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on January 2, 2025. Pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, the Issuer issued 264,087 shares of Common Stock to AstralBio on January 28, 2025. The Reporting Person is the Chief Executive Office and majority shareholder of AstralBio. As a result, the Reporting Person may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial ownership of the shares directly beneficially owned by AstralBio. Pursuant to Rule 13d-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Reporting Persons declare that filing this Schedule 13G shall not be construed as an admission that the Reporting Person is, for the purposes of Section 13(d) and/or Section 13(g) of the Exchange Act, the beneficial owner of any Common Stock directly owned by AstralBio and covered by this Schedule 13G except to the extent of such person's direct ownership of such Common Stock, and except to the extent of such direct ownership, such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed by each Reporting Person. In addition, on April 1, 2024, the Reporting Person received (i) 175,438 shares of Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 175,438 shares of Common Stock (subject to a 9.99% beneficial ownership blocker) in connection with a private placement transaction.
