        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>As of the close of business on January 6, 2025, the Reporting Persons and a certain Partners managed account (the "Partners Managed Account") held Pre-Funded Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the "Pre-Funded Warrants") exercisable for an aggregate of 2,526,444 shares of the Issuer's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Shares"). The Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable immediately, do not expire, and have an exercise price of $0.0001 per Share. The Reporting Persons and the Partners Managed Account (together with their affiliates and other attribution parties) may not exercise any portion of the Pre-Funded Warrants they hold to the extent that, immediately after giving effect to such issuance after exercise, they would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the outstanding Shares (the "Pre-Funded Warrants Blocker"). As of the close of business on January 6, 2025, the Pre-Funded Warrants Blocker did not limit the exercise of any of the Pre-Funded Warrants held by the Reporting Persons and the Partners Managed Account.

As of the close of business on January 6, 2025, (i) BVF beneficially owned 6,046,181 Shares, including 1,298,481 Shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants held by it, (ii) BVF2 beneficially owned 4,884,651 Shares, including 1,049,031 Shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants held by it and (iii) Trading Fund OS beneficially owned 607,975 Shares, including 130,569 Shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants held by it.

BVF GP, as the general partner of BVF, may be deemed to beneficially own the 6,046,181 Shares beneficially owned by BVF.

BVF2 GP, as the general partner of BVF2, may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,884,651 Shares beneficially owned by BVF2.

Partners OS, as the general partner of Trading Fund OS, may be deemed to beneficially own the 607,975 Shares beneficially owned by Trading Fund OS.

BVF GPH, as the sole member of each of BVF GP and BVF2 GP, may be deemed to beneficially own the 10,930,832 Shares beneficially owned in the aggregate by BVF and BVF2.

Partners, as the investment manager of BVF, BVF2 and Trading Fund OS, and the sole member of Partners OS, may be deemed to beneficially own the 11,764,000 Shares beneficially owned in the aggregate by BVF, BVF2 and Trading Fund OS and held in the Partners Managed Account, including 225,193 Shares held in the Partners Managed Account, which includes 48,363 Shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants held by it.

BVF Inc., as the general partner of Partners, may be deemed to beneficially own the 11,764,000 Shares beneficially owned by Partners.

Mr. Lampert, as a director and officer of BVF Inc., may be deemed to beneficially own the 11,764,000 Shares beneficially owned by BVF Inc.

The foregoing should not be construed in and of itself as an admission by any Reporting Person as to beneficial ownership of any Shares owned by another Reporting Person. BVF GP disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by BVF. BVF2 GP disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by BVF2. Partners OS disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by Trading Fund OS. BVF GPH disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by BVF and BVF2. Each of Partners, BVF Inc. and Mr. Lampert disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by BVF, BVF2 and Trading Fund OS and held in the Partners Managed Account, and the filing of this statement shall not be construed as an admission that any such person or entity is the beneficial owner of any such securities.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
