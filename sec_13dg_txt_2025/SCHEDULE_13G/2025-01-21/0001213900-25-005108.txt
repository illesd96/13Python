        <amountBeneficiallyOwned>(i) Immediately following the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement with the Issuer on January 15, 2025 (the "SPA") (as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2025), each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 205,230 Ordinary Shares, which consisted of (i) 200,000 Ordinary Shares to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA and (ii) 5,230 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA ("Intracoastal Warrant 1"), and all such Ordinary Shares represent beneficial ownership of approximately 9.99% of the Ordinary Shares, based on (1) 1,849,132 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as reported by the Issuer, plus (2) 200,000 Ordinary Shares to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA and (3) 5,230 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1. The foregoing excludes (I) 35,511 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1 because Intracoastal Warrant 1 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 1 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 9.99% of the Ordinary Shares and (II) 240,741 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of a second warrant to be issued to Intracoastal at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA ("Intracoastal Warrant 2") because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Ordinary Shares. Without such blocker provisions, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 481,482 Ordinary Shares.

(ii)  As of the close of business on January 21, 2025, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 209,827 Ordinary Shares, which consisted of (i) 40,741 Ordinary Shares held by Intracoastal and (ii) 169,086 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2, and all such Ordinary Shares represented beneficial ownership of approximately 4.99% of the Ordinary Shares, based on (1) 1,849,132 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as reported by the Issuer, plus (2) 2,145,998 Ordinary Shares in the aggregate issued at the closing of transaction contemplated by the SPA, (3) 40,741 Ordinary Shares issued to Intracoastal upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 1 and (4) 169,086 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2. The foregoing excludes 71,655 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of Intracoastal Warrant 2 because Intracoastal Warrant 2 contains a blocker provision under which the holder thereof does not have the right to exercise Intracoastal Warrant 2 to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise would result in beneficial ownership by the holder thereof, together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates, of more than 4.99% of the Ordinary Shares. Without such blocker provision, each of the Reporting Persons may have been deemed to have beneficial ownership of 281,482 Ordinary Shares.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
