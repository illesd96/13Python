        <ownershipMoreThan5PercentOnBehalfOfAnotherPerson>This Schedule 13G filing is jointly filed by The Charger Corporation, First Trust Portfolios L.P. and First Trust Advisors L.P. pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k)(1). The Charger Corporation is the General Partner of both First Trust Portfolios L.P. and First Trust Advisors L.P. First Trust Portfolios L.P. acts as sponsor of certain unit investment trusts which hold shares of the issuer. The total number of shares of the issuer held by these unit investment trusts is set forth in Row (8) above with respect to First Trust Portfolios L.P. No individual unit investment trust sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. holds more than 3% of any registered investment company issuer's shares. First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., acts as portfolio supervisor of the unit investment trusts sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P., certain of which hold shares of the issuer. Neither First Trust Portfolios L.P., First Trust Advisors L.P. nor The Charger Corporation have the power to vote the shares of the issuer held by these unit investment trusts sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. These shares are voted by the trustee of such unit investment trusts so as to insure that the shares are ordinarily voted as closely as possible in the same manner and in the same general proportion as are the shares held by owners other than such unit investment trusts. Subject to the requirements of Rule 12d1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and as further explained in the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust and related Trust Agreements of the unit investment trusts, First Trust Portfolios L.P., on behalf of the unit investment trusts, may enter into an agreement with a deposited fund which may permit the shares of such fund to be voted in the best interest of unit holders at the discretion of First Trust Portfolios L.P. The difference, if any, between the aggregate amount of shares beneficially owned by each reporting person, as set forth in Row (9) above, and the number of shares of the issuer held by the unit investment trusts sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. represents shares of the issuer which are either held in other registered investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and/or separately managed accounts for which First Trust Advisors L.P. serves as investment advisor and/or investment sub-advisor. Each of First Trust Portfolios L.P., First Trust Advisors L.P. and The Charger Corporation disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of the issuer identified in this filing.</ownershipMoreThan5PercentOnBehalfOfAnotherPerson>
