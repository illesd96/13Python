This Schedule 13G is being filed on a late, corrective basis pursuant to Rule 13d-1(d) to (i) report historical beneficial ownership that first became reportable upon the issuer's initial public offering (the IPO) and registration of the subject class, and (ii) report that the reporting persons no longer beneficially own any shares of the issuer's common stock. Prior to the IPO, Sofina Partners S.A. beneficially owned 7,840,708 shares, representing approximately 8.6% of the issuer's outstanding common stock immediately prior to the IPO. Following an internal reorganization, Sofina Partners S.A. merged with and into Sofina Capital S.A., with Sofina Capital S.A. as successor by merger. Sofina SA may be deemed to beneficially own the securities reported herein by virtue of its 100% ownership of Sofina Capital S.A. As of November 14, 2025, the reporting persons beneficially own 0 shares (0.0%) of the issuer's common stock, following sales completed in October and November 2025.</amountBeneficiallyOwned>
